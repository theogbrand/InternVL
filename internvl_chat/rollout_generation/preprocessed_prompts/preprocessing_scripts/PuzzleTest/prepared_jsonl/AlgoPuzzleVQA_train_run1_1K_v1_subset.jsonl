{"image": "images/map/map_0000.jpg", "question": "You are given an incomplete map of a country having 17 different regions. The objective is to colour the regions of the map using only the four available colours: red, green, blue and yellow, such that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. Adjacent regions are defined as two regions that share a common boundary of non-zero length. The regions indicated by numbers 1 to 13 have already been coloured, as shown in the image. The regions indicated by numbers 14 to 17 are shown in white as they are yet to be coloured. You need to assign colours to these regions in a way such that it doesn't violate the objective. Each unique colour combination of the regions would result in a unique complete map.

It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 4 moves such that the open position is seen moving in the following sequence: up, up, left, down.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0029.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 5 * 5 tile dimensions. It has 24 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 2 moves.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0031.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 4 * 4 tile dimensions. It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 4 moves such that the open position is seen moving in the following sequence: right, down, right, left.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0057.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 5 * 5 tile dimensions. It has 24 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 2 moves such that the open position is seen moving in the following sequence: right, right.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0070.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 4 * 4 tile dimensions. It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 3 moves.

It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 4 moves such that the open position is seen moving in the following sequence: left, down, left, right.
