Your final output should consist only of the LaTeX-formatted box with the answer and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.", "answer": "70", "uid": "c5ea4fdd-7687-40d0-9607-5860c474ff24", "image_path": "/data/users/brandon/ob1-projects/InternVL/internvl_chat/rollout_generation/preprocessed_prompts/preprocessing_scripts/DVQA/subset_images/bar_train_00182652.png", "response": "[Visual Elements]\n<step_1>\nThe title at the top of the chart reads \"Most preferred objects\".\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe y-axis is labeled \"Percent of People\" and ranges from 0 to 100, in increments of 20.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe x-axis has five categories: motel, cloud, goal, flux, sound.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThere are five vertical bars, one for each category on the x-axis, indicating the percent of people who prefer each object.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nThe height of the bar labeled \"motel\" aligns with the 70 mark on the y-axis.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nThe question asks for the percentage of people who prefer the object \"motel\".\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLooking at the bar labeled \"motel\", its height reaches up to the 70 mark on the y-axis.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThis indicates that 70 percent of people prefer \"motel\".\n</step_3>\n\n<correct_answer>\n$\\boxed{70}$\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The title at the top of the chart reads \"Most preferred objects\".", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The y-axis is labeled \"Percent of People\" and ranges from 0 to 100, in increments of 20.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The x-axis has five categories: motel, cloud, goal, flux, sound.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "There are five vertical bars, one for each category on the x-axis, indicating the percent of people who prefer each object.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The height of the bar labeled \"motel\" aligns with the 70 mark on the y-axis.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The question asks for the percentage of people who prefer the object \"motel\".", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Looking at the bar labeled \"motel\", its height reaches up to the 70 mark on the y-axis.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "This indicates that 70 percent of people prefer \"motel\".", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}]}
