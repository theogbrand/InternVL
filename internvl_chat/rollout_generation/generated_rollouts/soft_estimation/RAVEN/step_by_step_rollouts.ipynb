In the first row, the objects are circles, with dark-light-dark fill pattern. In the second row, the objects are hexagons, with the same fill pattern as row one: black fill, outlined, black fill. Size is not the key; fill and shape seem more important.\\n</step_1>\\n<step_2>\\nIt seems the columns all have the same structure: \\n- First column: leftmost, shape (circle, hexagon, circle), all solid and dark/black (circle, hexagon, circle).\\n- Second column: center, shape (circle, hexagon, circle), all outlined or gray shapes (light fill or outline).\\n- Third column: rightmost, shape (circle, hexagon, ?), all solid and black (circle, hexagon, ?), all larger in size.\\n</step_2>\\n<step_3>\\nLooking specifically at the third row, the pattern seems to match the first two rows: left = large dark, center = smaller/lighter, right = large dark. So the missing piece should be a large, black-filled circle, matching the analogous items in the first and second rows.\\n</step_3>\\n<step_4>\\nAmong the answer choices, both #1 and #5 are large, solid black-filled circles. Number #5 is slightly darker, but both fit, and both are circles with solid fill. Comparing with the other answer choices, only these fit both the shape (circle) and fill (dark/black).\\n</step_4>\\n<step_5>\\nMatching exactly to the styling and the rest of the matrix, let's check the fill darkness: The third row first cell is a dark gray circle, not the pure black as previous rows. Therefore, the shading of the answer (not pure black, but dark gray) is important—a match for #6, which is a large, dark gray-filled circle.\\n</step_5>\\n<step_6>\\nTherefore, the best match is answer choice #6.\\n</step_6>\\n\\n<correct_answer>\\n6\\n</correct_answer>\\n\", 'You are an abstract reasoning puzzle expert.

In both the first and second rows, left → right, the shape remains the same (all circles or all hexagons), the size increases from medium to small to large, and the color changes (first: black circle → small/grey circle → large/black circle; second: black hexagon → small/outlined hexagon → large/black hexagon).\\n</step_1>\\n<step_2>\\nThe third row so far: large, dark-grey circle → small, light-grey circle → ?.

Black filled hexagon\\n</step_5>\\n\\n[Reasoning]\\n<step_1>\\nFirst, examine the pattern within each row. The top row uses circles; all are circles, but colors alternate: black, light gray with outline, black. The second row uses polygons: pentagons and hexagons. The left is a solid pentagon, the center is a white outlined pentagon, and the right is a solid hexagon.\\n</step_1>\\n<step_2>\\nBy analogy, bottom row (Row 3) also uses circles. Left is a dark gray circle, center is a light gray circle with a black outline, right is missing.\\n</step_2>\\n<step_3>\\nLooking horizontally: Row 1's sequence is black, light gray, black (so the side cells match). Row 2's sequence changes the shape: pentagon, outlined pentagon, hexagon. It seems the center cell is always an outlined version of the left shape, the right cell is either the shape with more sides (pentagon to hexagon), or in the case of circles, the color repeats.\\n</step_3>\\n<step_4>\\nLook at the columns: Column 1: black (circle), black (pentagon), dark gray (circle). Column 2: light gray (circle), outlined (pentagon), light gray (circle). \\nColumn 3: black (circle), black (hexagon), [missing].\\n</step_4>\\n<step_5>\\nColor progression in circles: Row 3 left is dark gray, middle is light gray, so the right should likely match the pattern of color from Row 1 (where both side circles are the same).\\n</step_5>\\n<step_6>\\nComparing left and right ends in Row 3, and considering the pattern in Row 1, where both sides are black and the center is light gray, the right cell in Row 3 should mirror the left—so, a dark gray circle.\\n</step_6>\\n<step_7>\\nAmong the answer options, the dark gray filled circle option (Option 1 or 5) matches the color and form of R3C1. Option 1 and 5 appear visually identical.\\n</step_7>\\n<step_8>\\nTo ensure accuracy, check for any subtle differences. Option 1 (and 5) is a dark gray filled circle, matching the left cell in Row 3. This best continues the pattern present in Row 1 with matching sides.\\n</step_8>\\n\\n<correct_answer>\\nOption 1 (dark gray filled circle).\\n</correct_answer>\"]\n",
