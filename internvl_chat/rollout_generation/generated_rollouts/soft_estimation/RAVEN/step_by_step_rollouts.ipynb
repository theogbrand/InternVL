Large black circle.\\n2. Large gray-outlined gray-filled circle.\\n3. Black-filled triangle.\\n4. Large gray-outlined gray-filled circle (duplicate of 2).\\n5. Medium black-filled circle.\\n6. Large medium gray-filled circle.\\n7. Black-filled pentagon.\\n8. Black-filled hexagon.\\n</step_5>\\n\\n[Reasoning]\\n<step_1>\\nAnalyze each row for patterns. In the first row, all tiles are circles, with a progression in color/fill: black-filled, gray-filled with black outline, full black. The second row changes shape to pentagons and hexagons, with a progression in fill: black-filled pentagon, white-outlined pentagon, black-filled hexagon. The shapes get one more side from left to right (pentagon – 5 sides, hexagon – 6 sides).\\n</step_1>\\n<step_2>\\nFor each row, the middle cell is lighter or has an outline (gray or white); the left and right are fully filled, and the shape in the rightmost cell is also larger than the middle cell's shape.\\n</step_2>\\n<step_3>\\nLooking at columns: \\n- First column: black-filled circle, black-filled pentagon, dark gray-filled circle.\\n- Second column: all middle shapes are outlined and lighter (gray circle, outlined pentagon, light gray circle).\\n- Third column: black-filled circle, black-filled hexagon, missing.\\nSo, column 1 is filled, column 2 is light/outlined, column 3 is filled.\\n</step_3>\\n<step_4>\\nNow for the missing tile (row 3, column 3): in rows 1 and 2, the progression is from filled → outlined/light → filled (darker), with the rightmost cell in the first row being a black circle and in the second row a black hexagon. In both progressions, the middle cell is a lighter, smaller version of the shape used in the rest of the row.\\n</step_4>\\n<step_5>\\nComparing across the first and third row: the third row (first two cells) matches the first row in shape (circles) and color (gray → gray outlined). Thus, the missing tile should be a circle, matching the first row's third cell in style—in this case, fully black.\\n</step_5>\\n<step_6>\\nReview the answer set: Option 1 is a large black circle matching the third cell in the first row, so it fits as the missing piece. None of the other answer options are black-filled hexagons or differently outlined circles, so they don't fit the sequence or color pattern as well as option 1.\\n</step_6>\\n\\n<correct_answer>\\n1\\n</correct_answer>\"]\n",
