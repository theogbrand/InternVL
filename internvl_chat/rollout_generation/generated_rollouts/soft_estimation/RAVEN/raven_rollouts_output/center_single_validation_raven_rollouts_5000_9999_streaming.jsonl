But the first row advances shapes (pentagon→hexagon→circle, i.e., 5→6→circle), the second row shifts the shape \"down\" (diamond→pentagon→hexagon), and the third row mimics the first two starting shapes.\n</step_4>\n<step_4>\nNow, consider shading:\n- The shading in each row and column doesn't always progressively lighten or darken, but let's check for duplicates.\n- First and second columns of the third row are similar in shade to the second row, third column and first row, second column (mid-light gray).\n- First row, third column is a light gray circle. Second row, third column is a medium-dark hexagon. Third row, third column should continue with a circle and medium-dark like previous progressions.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nGiven:\n- In both the first and second rows, the rightmost item is \"two steps ahead\" in shape from the leftmost:\n  - Row 1: pentagon → hexagon → circle (i.e., moving \"up\" on number of sides then to closed curve).\n  - Row 2: diamond → pentagon → hexagon (adding one side per step).\n  - Row 3: starts again pentagon → hexagon → (? must be circle, following the previous patterns).\n- In the answer set, the only circles are options 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.\n- Now shading: given the pattern, the third shape is typically the same shade or a shade matching the previous two.\n- In the first row, the circle is light gray (option 3), but in the options, option 3 is the same as that; we need a new shade. The third column, second row is medium-dark gray (for the hexagon). The third row has medium-light gray hexagon, so the next should likely be a darker circle, matching the gradient.\n- Comparing shades, option 4 and option 8 are both medium-dark gray circles; option 8 matches best the shading from the third row's previous two tiles.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nThus, the missing tile should be a medium gray circle, matching the pattern of shapes and shading.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 8 (medium gray circle) is the correct answer.\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The first row of the matrix (left to right): \n- Small dark pentagon\n- Medium-light hexagon\n- Light gray circle", "score": 0.25, "num_mc_correct": 4, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The second row: \n- Solid black diamond\n- Large, very dark (almost black) pentagon\n- Medium-dark gray hexagon (with thick outline)", "score": 0.25, "num_mc_correct": 4, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "The third row:\n- Medium-dark gray pentagon\n- Medium-light gray hexagon\n- [Missing tile, marked with \"?\"]", "score": 0.3125, "num_mc_correct": 5, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Answer set, from 1 to 8:\n1.

The puzzle you will receive is presented in a standard Raven's Progressive Matrices format: a 3×3 matrix of related images, with the bottom-right cell (the ninth tile) missing. There are eight possible answer choices provided separately, and your task is to decide which of those eight images correctly completes the 3×3 matrix pattern.\n\nI will provide you with an image containing:\n- Problem Matrix: An accompanying image that shows the eight tiles and highlights where the ninth is missing.\n- Answer Set: The eight candidate images from which you must choose the best fit for the missing tile.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Review the problem matrix and the accompanying image in sequence, describing step-by-step what you see in the image in <perception> tags.\n- Reason step-by-step about the logical pattern or rule connecting the tiles in <reasoning> tags.\n- Deduce the correct tile from the eight provided options in <correct_answer> tags.\n\nIt is crucial that your solution contains these sections in the exact format described below:\n\n```\n[Perception]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_n>\n...(Step n of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_n>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_m>\n...(Step m of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_m>\n\n<correct_answer>\n...(Clearly state which of the 8 candidate images is the best candidate image as the missing tile to complete the matrix.
