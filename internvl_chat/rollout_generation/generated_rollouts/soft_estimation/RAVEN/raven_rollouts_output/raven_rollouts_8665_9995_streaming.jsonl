Across each row, left to right: the first row goes from medium gray (diamond), light gray (triangle), to black (hexagon). Second row: light gray (triangle), black (hexagon), medium gray (square). Third row: black (hexagon), medium gray (square), missing.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nEach row seems to rotate through three shapes with shading shifting with each step.

Going by this trend, the next logical shape would have fewer sides—triangle (3 sides).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow, let’s verify with the columns. The third column is hexagon (top right), square (middle right). So, following the downward progression—what precedes a hexagon (6) and a square (4) in a progression? A triangle (3 sides) fits logically.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nShading: The third row uses black for the hexagon, medium gray for the square. The sequence in other rows and columns is black → gray → light gray (but sometimes the combination is gray → black → gray), but in the second and third row, it goes black → medium gray → ?. So to continue the pattern, the triangle should be light gray.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nLooking at the answer set for a rightward-pointing, light gray triangle, answer 1 matches this description.

Notably, option 2 is a small outline diamond, 3 is a large, filled dark gray diamond, 5 is a large, filled dark gray diamond, 7 is a medium, solid black diamond, 8 is a small, solid black diamond.\n</step_6>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nAnalyzing rows: \nRow 1 transitions from a large, solid black diamond to a medium, solid dark gray diamond, and then to a small, outline diamond. The pattern: size decreases (large -> medium -> small), color or fill transitions from solid black -> dark gray -> outline. All shapes are diamonds.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nRow 2 deals with squares, not diamonds, but the transformation mirrors row 1: large, dark gray solid -> medium, outline -> small, solid black. The pattern is: large solid -> medium outline -> small solid (with a darker fill on the largest shape, lighter on smaller).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLooking at Row 3:\n- 1st cell: large, outline diamond,\n- 2nd cell: medium, solid black diamond,\n- 3rd cell: missing.\nComparing to the previous rows, the pattern for shape, color/fill, and size remains consistent. \n- The large version is at the first position, the medium version is at the second, and in the third we would expect a small version.\n- The fill alternates: Row 1 is black (solid) - gray (solid) - outline; Row 2 is gray (solid) - outline - black (solid); Row 3 is outline - black (solid) - ?\nSo, the logical fill would be solid gray for the missing third cell, to keep the color/fill order in consistency with the other rows.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nChecking in the answer set for a small, solid gray diamond. Answer 3 and 5 are both large, solid dark gray diamonds (but large in size, not small); answer 2 is a small, outline diamond; answer 7 is a medium, solid black; answer 8 is a small, solid black diamond.\nNo small, solid gray diamond is present. However, reviewing the need: If the outline version is first, black solid is second, the third should be a small, solid gray to match the rotation of shade and fill. Since small, solid black (option 8) is the closest available solid small diamond, but the color isn't matching the intended gray. Large gray diamonds (options 3 and 5) do not match in size.\nGiven the constraints among the candidate answers, the only small, solid diamond present is option 8 (small, solid black diamond).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nComparing to the columns: for each column, the pattern is that each contains one of each size (large, medium, small), and one of each shade/fill (black, gray, outline).\nSo, in column 3, the top is small, outline diamond; the middle is small, solid black square; so the bottom should be small, solid gray diamond ideally — but if not possible, the closest is a small, solid black diamond (option 8).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nAdditionally, of the candidate answers, all pentagons and triangles can be eliminated since they don’t fit the repeating diamond shape. Thus, the only valid size and fill option is option 8.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n8 (small, solid black diamond)\n</correct_answer>\n", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3x3 grid.

Each row uses a single geometric shape but varies the fill color or level of shading. \n- Top row: diamonds in three fill styles (white, light gray, outline only).\n- Middle row: pentagons in three fill styles (black, outline only, black).\n- Bottom row: triangles in three fill styles (white, light gray, ???).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nNext, examine fill progression in the rows:\n- Top row: white, then light gray, then outline/no fill. The last cell is an outline.\n- Middle row: black, outline/no fill, black again.\n- Bottom row (so far): white, light gray, ???.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nNow, look for consistent patterns:\n- For diamonds: progression goes from white (left), to light gray (middle), to outline (right).\n- For pentagons: black (left), outline (middle), black (right).\n- For triangles: white (left), light gray (middle), so by analogy with the diamond row, the next would be the outline only (just like cell 3 in row 1 is an outline-only diamond after white and light gray).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nHowever, note in the pentagon row, it cycles: black, outline, black. \n- This suggests that maybe columns follow a brighter > dimmer > outline pattern (in row 1), or alternate in row 2, but in row 3 we seem to be following the row 1 model, as color is changing gradually.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nSo, the third cell for triangles (third column, third row) should be a triangle with only the outline, no fill, matching the pattern of row 1, column 3 (outline-only diamond).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nCheck answer choices for an \"outline-only\" triangle (no fill, only outline). From the options:\n- 1: outlined triangle, white fill\n- 2: black filled triangle\n- 3: dark gray filled triangle\n- 4/7/8: light gray filled triangles\n- 6: outlined triangle, white fill (same as 1)\n\nNone of the answer choices are outline-only triangles; all have some fill.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nIf there is no \"outline-only\" triangle, then look for the answer with the least amount of fill, which aligns with going from maximum to minimum color intensity: white > light gray > (missing cell). White is least filled, but already used; next would be light gray, but already used in middle cell. \nIf outline-only isn't an option, perhaps repeating a previous answer is acceptable (as in the pentagon row, black > outline > black repeats black). Thus, the triangle row could go white > light gray > light gray.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nFrom the answer choices, light gray filled triangles are 4, 7, and 8. Any of these would complete the pattern in that logic.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\n4 (outlined triangle with light gray fill).
