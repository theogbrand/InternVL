Second row: all pentagons, with decreasing size and increasing darkness. Third row: all circles, with the same size progression (largest, then next-largest, then smallest), and color probably medium gray or black for the last (since first cell was black, second cell was light gray).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nFrom the answer choices, only three represent a small, dark circle: Option 3 is a small, gray circle. Option 8 is a large, dark gray/black circle. Option 2 is a medium circle dark gray in color.\nBut since the size progression in the third row is largest (first cell), large (second cell), and presumably medium/small (third cell), and considering the color sequence black, then light gray, the next logical color is the middle gray.\nOption 3 is a smaller gray circle, matching the pattern.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n3\n</correct_answer>",

The least “filled” diamond (unfilled) corresponded with previous cells being light gray, so a dark triangle seems logical as the next.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nBetween the 7 triangle options (1 through 7), choose the one with the fill matching the fill trend. Since previous step had unfilled, suggesting an increasing darkness, option 4 or 5 (both very dark/black triangle) would be suitable.\n\nHowever, since the pattern from row 2 goes from black to dark gray to light gray (left to right), and row 1 goes from dark gray to light gray to unfilled (left to right), it's possible that in row 3, the sequence is very light (pentagon), none (diamond), very dark (triangle). So, a black triangle is the best fit.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n4 (black-filled triangle)\n</correct_answer>",
