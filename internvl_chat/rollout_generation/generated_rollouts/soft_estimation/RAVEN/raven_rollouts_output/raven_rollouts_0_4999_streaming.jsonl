This would mean the missing pentagon should be the same shade as the triangle in position 3—the dark gray one.\nBut in the pentagon row, the first two shapes are black (left) and dark gray (middle). So, by analogy to the color progressions in the triangle row (white, black, dark gray), we are seeing a sequence where shades go from dark to lighter to even lighter.\n</step_5>\nIn the triangle row, going left to right, the colors lighten or are filled in: hollow (white), black, then dark gray. In the pentagon row, we have black, dark gray, so the next should be light gray (one step lighter).\n</step_6>\nAmong the answer set, the light gray pentagons are options 3 and 7. Both are nearly the same; however, option 7 matches the orientation and size/style of the shapes in the problem matrix.\n</step_7>\nTherefore, the correct answer is a solid light gray pentagon (option 7).\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n7\n</correct_answer>\n", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3x3 grid.
