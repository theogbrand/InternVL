It remains outlined in rows 1 and 3, filled gray in row 2. It decreases in size each row.\n- The third column is always a black triangle, apparently pointing right in all observed matrix examples.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nExamining the pattern of decrease: Shape size seems to reduce as you go down a row.\n- Circle: Large → Large (but darker) → Small.\n- Pentagon: Medium → Medium (filled) → Small.\n- Triangle: Possibly largest in row 1, slightly smaller (same size?) in row 2.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThere is a matching of color/fill patterns between columns within each row: \nIn row 1: circle is light gray, pentagon is only outlined, triangle is black.\nIn row 2: Circle is dark, pentagon is filled gray, triangle is black.\nIn row 3: Circle is light gray, pentagon is outlined, triangle is ?\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nBy extension, the missing tile should be a triangle. Its size and fill should match the \"progression\" of the row and column.\n- In column 3: all existing triangles are black filled and point right.\n- In row 3, both existing shapes are smaller than in previous rows.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nLooking at the answer set: All triangles point left except in the main matrix where all are pointing right (so likely the answer set has mirrored versions). Their fill shades differ, and sizes decrease as you move from options 4–8.\nCompare triangle size in the matrix (row 2 vs. row 1): not much size difference, perhaps just color/fill matters.\nColor/fill pattern: Row 2 has the darkest circle, the gray-filled pentagon, and black triangle. Row 1: all lighter (except the triangle).\nRow 3: Lightest circle, outlined pentagon, so the triangle here should be the lightest/least filled of all triangle options—likely an outlined or very light triangle.\n</step_7>\nRow 3 is consistently lightest in fill (circle is light gray, pentagon is outlined). So, the triangle should be left-facing (mirroring the answer set), and as light as possible—ideally an outline.\nFrom the answer set, option 8 is a leftward triangle with a thin outline and white inside, matching that pattern.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\n8\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The matrix has a 3×3 structure, with the bottom-right cell (third row, third column) missing.
