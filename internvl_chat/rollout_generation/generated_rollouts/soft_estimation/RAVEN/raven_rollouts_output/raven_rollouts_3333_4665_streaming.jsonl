It remains outlined in rows 1 and 3, filled gray in row 2. It decreases in size each row.\n- The third column is always a black triangle, apparently pointing right in all observed matrix examples.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nExamining the pattern of decrease: Shape size seems to reduce as you go down a row.\n- Circle: Large → Large (but darker) → Small.\n- Pentagon: Medium → Medium (filled) → Small.\n- Triangle: Possibly largest in row 1, slightly smaller (same size?) in row 2.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThere is a matching of color/fill patterns between columns within each row: \nIn row 1: circle is light gray, pentagon is only outlined, triangle is black.\nIn row 2: Circle is dark, pentagon is filled gray, triangle is black.\nIn row 3: Circle is light gray, pentagon is outlined, triangle is ?\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nBy extension, the missing tile should be a triangle. Its size and fill should match the \"progression\" of the row and column.\n- In column 3: all existing triangles are black filled and point right.\n- In row 3, both existing shapes are smaller than in previous rows.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nLooking at the answer set: All triangles point left except in the main matrix where all are pointing right (so likely the answer set has mirrored versions). Their fill shades differ, and sizes decrease as you move from options 4–8.\nCompare triangle size in the matrix (row 2 vs. row 1): not much size difference, perhaps just color/fill matters.\nColor/fill pattern: Row 2 has the darkest circle, the gray-filled pentagon, and black triangle. Row 1: all lighter (except the triangle).\nRow 3: Lightest circle, outlined pentagon, so the triangle here should be the lightest/least filled of all triangle options—likely an outlined or very light triangle.\n</step_7>\nRow 3 is consistently lightest in fill (circle is light gray, pentagon is outlined). So, the triangle should be left-facing (mirroring the answer set), and as light as possible—ideally an outline.\nFrom the answer set, option 8 is a leftward triangle with a thin outline and white inside, matching that pattern.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\n8\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The matrix has a 3×3 structure, with the bottom-right cell (third row, third column) missing.

There are two shape types: triangle, pentagon. Their shading can be dark, medium, light, or unshaded.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nObserving the placement: each row and column contains both triangles and pentagons, and each row seems to cycle between the two shapes. \nFirst row: triangle, pentagon, pentagon.\nSecond row: pentagon, pentagon, triangle.\nThird row: pentagon, triangle, ?\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow examine the shading sequence:\n- Top row: triangle is dark, pentagons are light and dark.\n- Middle row: pentagon (medium), pentagon (unshaded), triangle (medium).\n- Bottom row: pentagon (light), triangle (unshaded), ?\nThe shading in each row decreases in darkness from left to right for the first two rows.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nFocus on the third row, columns:\n- The first cell (pentagon, light) corresponds with the first column's sequence: triangle (dark), pentagon (medium), pentagon (light). Each step, the pentagon becomes lighter.\n- Second cell in third row: triangle (unshaded), which matches the pentagon (unshaded) above it in the same column.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nNow, aligning the patterns:\n- The third cell in each row alters between shapes and shades, appearing to replicate or complement the adjacent cells, mostly the previous row/column.\n- In the third column: pentagon (dark), triangle (medium), ?\nThat sequence suggests the missing third-row, third-column cell should be a triangle (since the top two entries are pentagon, triangle), and shading should be unshaded or white (following the decrease in shade: dark to medium to unshaded).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nCheck the answer set for a triangle (unshaded, outline only). Scanning all eight options, only answer 7 contains a triangle, but it's shaded. Only answer 3 is unshaded, but it is a circle. Only answer 6 is a pentagon (light shade).\nNone of the options match an unshaded triangle.

(missing).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nAnalyze columns:\n- Col 1: Pentagon (filled) → pentagon (outline) → circle (light fill).\n- Col 2: Diamond (filled) → pentagon (outline) → hexagon (light fill).\n- Col 3: Triangle (filled) → diamond (outline) → ?.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLook for consistent patterns:\n- Across rows, from left to right: The SHAPE changes with each row but within each row, there's often a progression—smaller → bigger/filled → unfilled/top to bottom shapes change. The third row always has light gray fill, and the shapes in the third row are progressing: circle (3 sides → 6 sides, skipping 5) → hexagon (6 sides).\n- Across columns, the fill alternates (filled, outline, filled), but for the third column, (light fill in first row, unfilled in second).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe key row-wise logic:\n- 1st row: Three different shapes (pentagon → diamond → triangle), all filled.\n- 2nd row: All polygons (pentagon → pentagon → diamond), all unfilled.\n- 3rd row: All filled, different shapes - circle → hexagon → ?\n\nIn the third row, from left to right:\n- Circle (3,1) (filled light gray), hexagon (3,2) (filled light gray), so (3,3): Should be a triangle (as row 1 ends with triangle, and the 'filled' alternate goes from light gray here).\nBut in (3,2) the shape is a hexagon, not triangle.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nLet’s check the number of sides:\n- Row 3: Circle (infinite), hexagon (6). The missing shape possibly is something with four sides? (As in row 2, the number of sides increases: pentagon → hexagon).\nBut column 3 has triangle → diamond → ?. Thus, shapes progress from triangle/diamond to possibly circle.\nBut looking at diagonal progressions does not clarify much.\nBut since the third row involves filled shapes, and it's polygonal, matching that, the answer should be a shape with 3, 6, then logically 4 or 5 sides.\nBut according to row progression:\n- Row 1: 5 (pentagon), 4 (diamond), 3 (triangle)\n- Row 2: 5 (pentagon), 5 (pentagon), 4 (diamond)\n- Row 3: circle, 6 (hexagon), ?\n\nSo perhaps sequence 3 (circle), 6 (hexagon), triangle (3 sides) is a plausible sequence. But in the answer set, the only filled figure is answer 4 (solid black pentagon), and answer 3 (circle, unfilled), but row three uses light gray fill.\nHowever, in row 1, the fill sequence is (dark gray, dark gray, light gray)—the triangle is filled with light gray in (1,3); in row 3, both tiles are filled light gray, so the missing tile most likely should be a triangle, filled light gray.\nBut none of the answer choices are a filled light gray triangle.\n\nLooking back, maybe the pattern maps sides: 5 (pentagon), 6 (hexagon), so possibly 7-sided (heptagon). No heptagon in answer set.\nAlternatively, perhaps the idea is to repeat the sequence from earlier (circle → hexagon → ?). Since the previous two are filled with light gray, must the third be filled light gray? But none in answer set.\n\nNow, look for possible consistent fit from the answer set shapes and rows:\n- Row 1: All shapes are filled (either dark or light). Row 3: all shapes filled light gray.\n- Row 2: all shapes unfilled.\n\nSo among answer choices, only outline shapes are available, except black-filled pentagon (too dark for row 3 given other two are light gray), or outline circle.\nTherefore, the only plausible answer from available choices, in terms of relatable pattern, must be the circle (answer 3, outline circle), to continue shape progression: circle → hexagon → circle (or possibly matching fill, but constrained by options).\n\nHowever, the matrix pattern for row 3 seems to be: filled light gray shape, polygon with increasing number of sides (circle, hexagon, ?). The next logical polygon with more sides than hexagon would be heptagon (7 sides), but not available. Alternatively, among available choices, the only shapes matching fill (even if unfilled) and complexity are hexagon (answer 6) or pentagon (answer 5).\n\nHowever, answer 3 is an outline circle, which matches the shape but not the fill, so not ideal.

The filled black square is already used, and triangle does not match.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nChoosing among filled black circles, let's look at size.
