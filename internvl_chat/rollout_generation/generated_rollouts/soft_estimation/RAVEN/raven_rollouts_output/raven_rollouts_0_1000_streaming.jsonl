In the possible answers, the only non-triangle shape is (8): a heptagon (7 sides).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nNow check the progression:\nTop row: Pentagon (gray), Pentagon (darker), Diamond (outline only).\nMiddle row: Circle (black), Pentagon (filled dark gray), Pentagon (filled light gray).\nBottom row: Pentagon (large, gray), Diamond (outline only, larger), ?\nLooks like a sequence based on changing the shape and number of sides:\n- Row 3 is replicating the shapes in row 1, but larger, with a fill.\n   - Row 1: Pentagon, Pentagon, Diamond (outline)\n   - Row 3: Large pentagon (filled), Large diamond (outline), thus the missing shape should be a large, filled version of the shape in the top right.\nBut the shape in the top right is a diamond (outline, no fill), already present in bottom center! \nSo maybe the missing shape is the next logical geometric shape with fewer or more sides.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nNow let's look at the possible answer shapes: They are all triangles, except for the last (8), which is a heptagon (7-sided polygon).\n- Since the top row has pentagons (5 sides) and a square (4 sides, diamond orientation), it would make sense the next shape is a triangle (3 sides).\n- The row seems to descend in the number of sides: 5 → 4 → 3.\n</step_8>\n<step_8>\nFrom the answer set, the only triangles available are in answers 1–7. All have similar shapes but differ in shading.\n- Let’s check the shading progression of each row.\n   - The top row: gray pentagon, darker gray pentagon, outline-only diamond (no fill)\n   - The bottom row: light gray pentagon, outline-only diamond\n   - Columns: The right column has an outline-only diamond at the top and outline-only diamond at the bottom.

In row 3, both visible tiles are pentagons, so perhaps the missing tile should be a square—matching a pattern of shapes within rows or columns (not color, as shades don't cycle or invert reliably).\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nAlternatively, check for another pattern: The shapes in third row, so far, are both pentagons, but all answer set choices are squares except one (pentagon, answer 7). In row 2, the sequence is square, pentagon, hexagon—number of sides increases by 1 each step. If the same logic carried in row 3, and assuming the row begins with a pentagon (5 sides), followed by a pentagon (also 5 sides), the next should be a square (4 sides) or hexagon (6 sides).

In the first row, the shapes progress in number of sides: square (4), pentagon (5), triangle (3). In the second row: pentagon (5), triangle (3), diamond (4). The diamond is a square rotated 45 degrees, so still 4 sides. \n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLooking at columns: First column (square, pentagon, triangle), second column (pentagon, triangle, square), third column (triangle, diamond, ?). There's cycling of shapes: square → pentagon → triangle; next row starts with pentagon → triangle → diamond (rotated square), so shape alternates and rotates/cycles.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLet’s focus on shading. The top row: all dark. Middle row: all dark. Bottom row: all medium gray. So, the missing tile in the bottom-right must be medium gray.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nNow let’s confirm the pattern by the specific sequence. In each row, the first two shapes determine the third:\n- Top row: square, pentagon, triangle\n- Second row: pentagon, triangle, diamond\n- Bottom row: triangle, square, ?\n\nColumn-wise: the first two in the bottom row are triangle, square. If the pattern matches the rows above (e.g., third shape is not present in first two), given that in other rows the third differs from the first two, it would seem the next shape should be a pentagon.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nSo, the answer we seek is a medium gray pentagon.

The sizes are decreasing each row: large → small → medium, and the fill style transitions from filled → filled → outlined in the first cell of each row.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nGiven the sequence square → hexagon → ?, and the other rows rotate their shapes cyclically, the next shape after hexagon, following the earlier rotation pattern, should be circle. But circle already appeared in that column.\nInstead, let's observe geometric transformations: \n- First cell in each row: circle, pentagon, square — all regular polygons, number of sides increases by one: 4 (square), 5 (pentagon), 6 (hexagon). So perhaps the missing shape is a polygon with more sides. However, in this matrix, the shapes in each row are all different: row 1 (circle, diamond, pentagon), row 2 (pentagon, circle, diamond), row 3 (square, hexagon, ?).\nBut the third row uses unique shapes not previously in that row and with regularity in the transformation:\n- The number of sides: square (4), hexagon (6), next should be 8 (octagon) if the pattern increases by two. No octagon in the answer set, so perhaps not this.\nTry columns:\n- The third column: pentagon (large/filled), diamond (small/filled), missing.\n  - So, row 1: large, filled black shape.\n  - Row 2: corresponding shape from previous row but moved over and smaller.\n  - If row 3: first is unfilled (square), second is hexagon (medium, filled, light gray), third should match—what—by either shape, fill, or size?\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nCheck for the shading and size:\n- First row: all large and dark.\n- Second row: all small and darker.\n- Third row: outlined, medium/light fill, and likely medium size.\nFrom answer choices, only one matches being a medium, gray-filled circle: answer 8.\nChecking column patterns: \nFirst column: circle, pentagon, square.\nSecond column: diamond, circle, hexagon.\nThird column: pentagon, diamond, (missing).\nShapes are rotated each row (moving left to right), so in the third row, the logical next shape would be circle.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nTherefore, to complete the pattern, the missing tile should be a medium-size, gray-filled circle.

In each row, the shapes appear to be of different types and/or sizes, and their shading varies.

Looking at the first column: goes from large circle → medium pentagon → small square. The second column: large diamond → medium circle → small hexagon. Third column: large pentagon → medium diamond → ?\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nIn each column, there seems to be a rotation or sequence among the set of available shapes: circle, diamond, pentagon, hexagon, square. Let's match up the patterns more tightly:\n- First column: Circle → Pentagon → Square\n- Second column: Diamond → Circle → Hexagon\n- Third column: Pentagon → Diamond → ?\nSo the missing shape should continue the sequence: Pentagon → Diamond → ?\nProbably, the next step should be \"Circle,\" to match the sequence in other columns. Alternatively, since both other columns feature \"Circle\" as third item, that further suggests the answer is likely a small circle.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nLet's check which options in the answer set could fit: The missing shape should be small (as the previous two in the same row are small), and a circle. Checking the answer set, the small circles are options 5 and 7. \nComparing shades: The pattern in the third row is: white (outline, not filled) square → filled hexagon (gray/lighter). So, in the third cell, we should continue with a filled gray or possibly dark gray circle (depending on the shading correspondence to the sequences above). \nIn the middle row (the same column as the missing entry), the diamond is solid black. However, shade is mainly consistent with shape size (the sixth cell, small hexagon, is light gray), so the small circle might have a similar shade.\nOption 5 matches best: a small gray circle, similar to the gray used in the small hexagon.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n5 (Small gray circle)\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "Top row (left to right): \n- First cell: Large, dark gray circle.\n- Second cell: Large, diamond-shaped (square rotated 45°), black shape.\n- Third cell: Large, black pentagon.", "score": 0.0, "num_mc_correct": 0, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Middle row (left to right):\n- First cell: Medium, light gray pentagon.\n- Second cell: Medium, gray circle.\n- Third cell: Medium, black diamond (square rotated 45°).", "score": 0.125, "num_mc_correct": 2, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Bottom row (left to right):\n- First cell: Small, white square outline.\n- Second cell: Small, light gray hexagon.\n- Third cell: Missing (the one we need to find).", "score": 0.0, "num_mc_correct": 0, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Answer set (left to right, top to bottom): \n1.

Answer 6 is a small black-filled pentagon.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's analyze the pattern by rows:\n- Top row: All hexagons. The first and third are large and filled light gray; the middle is small and unfilled. The fill and size alternate in the row.\n- Middle row: All diamonds. The first two are identical in size and fill (gray), the third is small and unfilled.\n- Bottom row (pentagons): The first is small and black, the second is larger and black, appearing in a rotated orientation relative to the first.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nNow analyze down the columns:\n- First column: Large filled hexagon, medium filled diamond, small filled black pentagon.\n- Second column: Small unfilled hexagon, larger filled diamond, large black filled pentagon (rotated).\n- Third column: Large filled hexagon, small unfilled diamond, missing pentagon.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nAnalyzing the transformation across each row:\n- In rows 1 and 2: The third object in the row matches the form (shape) of the first, the fill of the first, the size of the second, and the orientation of the first.\n- However, in row 2, the first two diamonds are filled and same-sized; the third is small and unfilled.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nLook at the consistency in fills and size:\n- In every row, the third item seems to combine traits of its row and column: For shape, it always matches the row (hexagon, diamond, pentagon). For fill, it matches the first in the row (row 1: filled, row 2: filled, row 3: filled). For size, it tends to be small if the first two are large, or large if the first is small, or following a reduction/enlargement pattern.\n- In columns (especially third): Top: hexagon (large, filled), middle: diamond (small, unfilled), bottom: ?pentagon (should be small, unfilled or at least smallest in the row or column).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nBut considering the bottom row progression specifically:\n- The pentagons move from small black (left) to large rotated black (middle). If consistent, the last should be small and unfilled (to match the reduction pattern seen in row 2, or to match the sequence of forms). But unfilled pentagons are not among answer choices; only black-filled or gray-filled.\n- In row 1: large filled, small unfilled, large filled. In row 2: filled, filled, unfilled (and small).\n- Thus, the most consistent pattern is that the third cell is the same size as the second, but changes fill to either unfilled or the opposite of what is beside it.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nHowever, given that both the first and second pentagons in the row are filled black, and the only other variable that changes is the orientation or size, the most likely answer is to continue the \"size change\" trend—small, then large, then small again, or match the size reduction from previous rows. Since answer option 6 is a small black-filled pentagon, it is the most likely continuation of the pattern.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n6 (the small black-filled pentagon)\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The matrix is a 3x3 grid.

The first row is all large light-gray-filled shapes: hexagon, square, pentagon. The second row follows the same shapes in a new order and style: square (gray filled), pentagon (outline only), hexagon (outline only). The third row corresponds to the previous shapes in solid black fill: pentagon, hexagon, ?. \n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nObserve the transformations:\n- Row 1: All filled shapes, different types.\n- Row 2: Shapes from the previous row but shifted left.\n  - First column: Row 1, col 2 shape (square), filled and smaller.\n  - Second column: Row 1, col 3 shape (pentagon), outlined, no fill.\n  - Third column: Row 1, col 1 shape (hexagon), outlined, no fill.\nSo, each row starts with the shape that was in the previous row's next column; it's a left shift of the shape, and the style changes: from filled > outlined/no fill (mid row) > solid black (bottom row).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThird row:\n- Column 1: Shape was in row 2, column 2: pentagon. This matches: black pentagon.\n- Column 2: Shape was in row 2, column 3: hexagon.

In each row and column, the shades rotate but generally correspond to the position in the cycle.\nLooking at the second column: triangle, square, pentagon. Comparing their third shape, it completes the set of three repeating shapes: triangle → square → pentagon.\nConsidering the shapes across the diagonal, there is a pentagon in different shading in each.\nSo perhaps the missing shape in the third row and third column should continue this pattern. The third column has: diamond (light), pentagon (light), ?\nFirst row, third column is diamond, second row, third column is pentagon, so the next shape should be triangle (to continue the cycle: diamond, pentagon, triangle).\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nGiven this, the missing shape is likely to be a triangle. Now, for the color/shading and orientation, let's check the pattern.\nIn the third row, first is a dark diamond, second is a dark pentagon, so the third should be a dark triangle.\nChecking answer choices: The available triangles are: \n1 (small, white upright), 2 (small, dark upright), 4 (medium, white upright), 5 (small, medium-gray upright), 6 (large, dark downward), 7 (small, light upright), 8 (small, dark upright).\nThe most consistent with the pattern is a dark upright triangle, similar to the shading.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nComparing the previous two elements in the row (row 3): diamond (darkest shade), pentagon (medium shade), so the triangle could be the lightest shade.\nHowever, given the second column, pentagon shade matches the first column's shade.\nSo, the answer is a small, dark upright triangle (choice 2 or 8).\nBut let's check orientation: The triangle in row 2, column 1 is downward, but in the answer choices, only answer 6 (large, dark downward) points downward. However, the rest of the triangles point up.\nBut looking at the broader context, the triangle is likely to be upright, based on the earlier sequence.\nSo, answer 2 or answer 8.\nChecking size: The pentagon, diamond, and triangle are all similar in scale, so size matches.\nFinal check: Only answer 2 is a small, dark upright triangle.

Medium gray filled triangle\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet’s analyze the pattern across the matrix rows and columns. Start with rows:\n- Row 1: pentagon, diamond, triangle (all filled, getting lighter in shade; number of sides decreases left to right: 5, 4, 3).\n- Row 2: pentagon, square, triangle (pentagon filled gray, square outlined, triangle outlined; similar shape sequence: 5, 4, 3 sides).\n- Row 3: circle (outline filled), pentagon (filled dark), missing.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nNow, analyze columns:\n- Column 1: dark pentagon, medium pentagon, black circle. (Sizable pentagons, then a circle in last row.)\n- Column 2: medium diamond, outlined square, large dark pentagon (shapes with 4 sides in top two cells, then a pentagon in last row).\n- Column 3: light triangle, outlined triangle, missing cell (could be another triangle or next in sequence).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nRows 1 and 2 suggest a sequence of decreasing sides: pentagon -> quadrilateral -> triangle, moving left to right. The fill style changes as well: Row 1 is filled; Row 2 is outlined (or less filled). Row 3 is more about bold fills and possible shape transformation across the row: first a circle, then a large pentagon.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nLet’s focus on Row 3. The progression from left to right might be similar to rows above. Since the first is a circle (shapeless sides), then a pentagon, it’s logical the pattern is: circle (infinite sides, or start), pentagon (5 sides), then should come a shape with 4 sides (diamond or square), since above it's pentagon -> square or diamond -> triangle.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nHowever, in Row 3, the first two cells are more filled/darker than the above rows. In each row, the fill style and the number of sides decrease left to right.\n- Row 1: dark pentagon (5 sides), medium diamond (4), light triangle (3).\n- Row 2: medium pentagon (5), outlined square (4), outlined triangle (3).\n- Row 3: dark circle, dark pentagon (5), and missing.\nThere’s no triangle in the answer set that matches the fill and matches with the row, but a dark diamond (4 sides, like a square or diamond, as seen in the other rows) could fit the pattern.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nLooking closer at the Answer Set, answer 7 is a dark gray diamond, which matches the fill pattern and shape progression for Row 3, continuing the \"number of sides decreases\" sequence: circle (infinite) -> pentagon (5) -> diamond (4).\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nThus, the missing tile should be a diamond with similar fill to the row, which is what answer 7 provides.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n7 (dark gray diamond)\n</correct_answer>\n", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The matrix is a 3x3 grid with eight tiles filled and the bottom-right tile missing (the ninth tile is labeled with a question mark).", "score": 0.0, "num_mc_correct": 0, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Row 1 (left to right): \n- First cell: a dark pentagon.\n- Second cell: a medium gray diamond.\n- Third cell: a light gray triangle.", "score": 0.0625, "num_mc_correct": 1, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Row 2 (left to right):\n- First cell: a medium gray pentagon.\n- Second cell: a square (outline only).\n- Third cell: a triangle (outline only).", "score": 0.125, "num_mc_correct": 2, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Row 3 (left to right):\n- First cell: a black-filled circle.\n- Second cell: a dark gray large pentagon.\n- Third cell: missing (question mark).", "score": 0.0, "num_mc_correct": 0, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Below the main matrix are eight answer options, labeled 1 to 8.

Notice: \n- Row 1: pentagon, square, triangle (all filled, with increasingly lighter shades left→right).\n- Row 2: pentagon, square, triangle (first filled mid-gray, then outlined—no fill, next outlined—no fill). So, third one is outlined only.\n- Row 3: circle, heptagon filled dark, missing shape. The triangle shape appears in position three in both previous rows. But since row 3 starts with a circle, then a heptagon, the idea is the missing shape should logically be a triangle analog (lowest sides in the sequence) or matching the color/fill pattern in its row/column.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nLooking down each column:\n- First column: Filled pentagon, filled pentagon (lighter), filled circle.\n- Second column: Filled diamond (4 sides), outlined square, filled/dark heptagon (7 sides).\n- Third column: Filled triangle, outlined triangle, (missing).\nSo, in the third column, the pattern is: filled shape, outlined shape, missing. In all other cases the sequence goes filled→outlined→?\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nColumn pattern suggests the most consistent answer would be a filled dark shape in the third cell (since filled, outlined, filled), and to fit with left-to-right shape complexity decrease, the third cell should be a triangle, but the other options are pentagons or diamonds.\n</step_8>\n<step_8>\nLooking at answer choices: Only option 8 is a triangle, filled with gray.
