In each row, all three shapes are different: Row 1 is square, hexagon, circle. Row 2 is circle, diamond, irregular pentagon. Row 3 is hexagon, circle, [missing].\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nObserve the columns: Column 1 is square, circle, hexagon. Column 2 is hexagon, diamond, circle. Column 3 is circle, pentagon, [missing].\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nEach row and column appears to have a unique set of shapes, never repeating within the same row or column.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nLook for the pattern for Row 3. The first two entries are hexagon and circle, so the missing shape must be a third unique shape not used yet in that row—square, diamond, or pentagon.\n</step_5>\nBut examine the columns: In column 3, the first two are circle and pentagon, so the missing shape can't be a circle or pentagon. So it could be hexagon, square, or diamond.\nHowever, in Row 3, the hexagon is already used, so the missing shape can't be a hexagon or circle. That leaves diamond, square, or pentagon.\nBut since both the diamond and pentagon are more irregular, and previous patterns avoid repeating one's from the same row/column.\n</step_6>\nBut let's look at the SHADES. Each row uses three different shades (Row 1: dark, darker, nearly black; Row 2: dark, black, black; Row 3: light gray, medium gray, [missing ugly]).\nIt would make sense to use the next logical step in the sequence—so a square of a third, distinct shade.\n</step_7>\nNow focus further: The only left-out main shape in Row 3 in both its row and column is SQUARE. Also, Row 3 so far: hexagon, circle—so square would fit as the third shape.\nAmong the answer choices, there are several squares: (3) dark gray, (4) medium gray, (5) light gray, (7) mid gray.\nBut shades are important: In Row 3, the existing hexagon is light gray, and the circle is medium gray. The last square should be in a distinct gray shade from those two.\n</step_8>\nFrom the answer set: option (3) is a dark gray square, which is a new shade in this row.

Light gray diamond, black outline.  \n6. Small light gray diamond, black outline.  \n7. Black diamond, black outline.  \n8. Gray circle, black outline.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLook for the pattern, examining the rows and columns: Shapes change both by number of sides and fill color. Let’s break row-wise first:\n- Row 1: Heptagon (7) → Pentagon (5) → Diamond (4)\n- Row 2: Hexagon (6) → Pentagon (5) → Square (4)\n- Row 3: Pentagon (5) → Pentagon (5) → ?\nIt appears that the number of sides decreases as we move from left to right, and sometimes the shape also changes. The color/gray shade gets lighter or less filled to the right.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nColumn-wise:\n- Column 1: Heptagon (7, black), Hexagon (6, black), Pentagon (5, gray)\n- Column 2: Pentagon (5, gray), Pentagon (5, gray), Pentagon (5, gray)\n- Column 3: Diamond (4, light gray), Square (4, black), ?\nColumns 1 and 2: The first column’s number of sides decreases by one each row; the second column stays as pentagons but changes in size/shade. The third column reduces number of sides to 4 in each (diamond or square), and shading can be lighter (diamond row 1), black (square row 2). So, the missing shape at (3,3) should maintain this “4-sided” consistency, matching a diamond or square.\n</step_3>\n<step_3>\nAssess color/shade: For each row, the color seems to get lighter to the right; row 1 - black → outline → light gray; row 2 - black → gray → black; row 3 - gray → gray → ?. The only available answer candidates that are diamonds or squares are 1-3, 5-7. Options 1 (white/outline), 3 (medium gray outline), 5 (light gray outline), 6 (small light gray), 7 (black). But in the third row, both tiles so far are filled gray pentagons, so it would make sense for the rightmost tile to be a filled, not outline, shape.\n</step_4>\n<step_4>\nCheck size: The rightmost images in rows 1 & 2 are smaller than left image; matching the pattern, the third image should be a small 4-sided shape, possibly a diamond (since row above has a square; alternate form of 4 sides).\nOption 6 is the small, light gray filled diamond, which matches the sizing and style of the rightmost image in the first row (smallest, lightest).
