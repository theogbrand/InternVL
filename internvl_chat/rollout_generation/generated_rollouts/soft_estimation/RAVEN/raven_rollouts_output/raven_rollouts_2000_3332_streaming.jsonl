Each row contains three different shapes (pentagon, diamond, triangle/circle/hexagon), and the color/fill transitions from dark/filled to light/unfilled as you move right. Each row uses a different set of shapes.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLooking at columns:\n- Column 1: Pentagon (filled), Pentagon (filled, rotated), Circle (unfilled)\n- Column 2: Pentagon (unfilled), Diamond (filled), Hexagon (unfilled)\n- Column 3: Diamond (filled), Triangle (filled), ?\nEach column contains different shapes, with shading/fill progressing from filled/solid on top to outline/unfilled at the bottom.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nFocus on the bottom row (row 3): Circle, Hexagon, ?. \nBoth are basic shapes, outlined only, no fill. The pattern so far is: introduce a new shape not present in rows above, outlined only, not filled. The next logical shape in this sequence would be different from the circle and hexagon and should fit this pattern.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe only shape in the answer set that fits a new, outlined, unfilled shape not yet present in that row is the pentagon. But pentagons are used twice in previous rows (but here, the only options in the answer set are variants of pentagons and circles; no triangle or diamond available).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nComparing to the other rows: the first row’s left tile is a filled pentagon, the second row left tile is a rotated pentagon, the third row left tile is a circle, the middle is a shape with more sides than the left one in the respective row (pentagon → diamond [4 sides], pentagon → diamond [4 sides], circle → hexagon [6 sides]). Hence, perhaps sequence by increasing number of sides: circle (infinite) → hexagon (6 sides) → the missing tile should be a shape different from these, already present in the previous columns but not in this row: triangle (3 sides)—but triangle is not present in the answer set. The next candidate is a pentagon (5 sides), which is available in many possible sizes in the answer set.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nTo be consistent with the bottom row (circle, hexagon, ?), and match the unfilled, outlined style, the correct answer must be a white-outlined, unfilled pentagon.

If following row 1's pattern of decrement by 1, we might expect a 3-sided shape (triangle), but that's not in the answer set.\nLooking at column 3: 4 (diamond), 7 (heptagon), ?\nSo, the third column goes from 4 → 7 → ?, suggesting an increase of 3 sides.

In the third row, after pentagon and hexagon, the next step is again a circle by this logic.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow check the shading. In the second row, the circle is dark filled. In the third row, the hexagon is darker than the (lightly filled) hexagon in row one, possibly suggesting this circle should be similarly dark filled.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nThe size progression in columns and rows also goes from small, to medium, to large.

Unfilled large downward triangle\n8. Unfilled large downward triangle (this appears visually similar to 7).\n</step_3>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nIdentify the logic or pattern connecting shapes and fills across the rows and columns. Each row uses one shape type, decreases in size, and/or alternates between filled and unfilled outlines:\n- Row 1: Unfilled circle → filled pentagon → filled triangle.\n- Row 2: Filled circle → unfilled pentagon → filled triangle (pointing down).\n- Row 3: Small unfilled circle → filled pentagon → [missing].\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nEach row starts with a circle, then pentagon, then triangle, and the fill alternates between filled and unfilled as you move across each row or down each column.\n- Column 1: Unfilled circle, filled circle, small unfilled circle.\n- Column 2: Filled pentagon, unfilled pentagon, filled pentagon.\n- Column 3: Filled triangle, filled downward triangle, [missing].\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nNow, compare the third column:\n- Top: Filled triangle (pointing up).\n- Middle: Filled triangle (pointing down).\n- Bottom: [missing].\nLooking for patterns: the triangle in this final cell should continue the logic.\nShape progression: regular triangle → downward triangle → ?\nFill pattern: Both are filled.\nSize: The triangles are visually similar in size, but the direction changes.\n- Top: triangle, up.\n- Middle: triangle, down.\n- So the next should be... triangle, up? Or maybe small, or just filled, alternating pattern?\nBut let's check the columns for further guidance.\n</step_4>\nColumn 3 must feature triangles, and the fill style is always filled. The only thing changing is orientation: up, then down. The natural alternation would suggest the last triangle should be pointing up (returning to the top's orientation), and still be filled, to follow the pattern.\n</step_5>\nNow, checking the answer set: Only one tile shows a filled, upward-pointing triangle—however, option 1 shows a filled downward triangle, similar to the second row and third column, and option 5 shows a large downward triangle shaded, similar to the second column, second row. No answer directly matches a small or unfilled upward triangle. Options 7 and 8 are both unfilled, upward triangles. The original third tile in the first row is a filled, small triangle and points upward. Therefore, continuing the filled and orientation alternation should make the answer a filled, upward triangle, but none is present, so perhaps the pattern expects a filled, downward triangle again (since that's the repeat in the column), which would make option 1 (the filled downward triangle) correct, matching the filled-ness and orientation.\n</step_6>\nComparing further, option 5 is a shaded downward triangle, but it is significantly larger than the triangles above it, which breaks the relative size progression seen in each row and column.

The unfilled shape is always middle-sized, otherwise filled and changing size from small to large across the row.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nIn Row 2 (diamonds): The sequence goes from small, black filled → medium, gray filled → large, dark-gray filled. The size increases left to right, and the fill goes from darkest to lighter, then back to darker but not black.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nIn Row 3 (triangles): The left and center cells show a progression in the size of the triangle: left is smallest (unfilled), center is medium-sized (unfilled), so the missing right cell should be a large triangle.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nFor filling: Both preceding triangles are unfilled, so by analogy to the earlier rows, the third shape should be large and likely filled (as rows above go from unfilled/filled to filled/unfilled in the third cell).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nComparing with the answer set: Options 3 and 5 are unfilled triangles, option 5 is larger; options 6, 7, and 8 are large filled triangles (6: dark; 7: light; 8: medium gray).\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nThe pattern for fill: In the previous two rows, the fill in the third cell is similar to the first but adjusted for size and shade; the third cell is also filled (Row 1 hexagon is filled, Row 2 diamond is filled).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nTherefore, the triangle should be the largest and filled.

Shape sequence: square → hexagon → circle.\n- Col 3: Circle (gray fill), square (dark gray fill), ?. \n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nDiagonal and transformation patterns don't seem primary.

So the third one is the darkest. Therefore, the last should also be as dark as possible.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nComparing #1 and #8: Both are large black hexagons, but #1 has a black outline, #8 does not. The second row hexagon (2,2) has an outline and gray fill, but in the third row the pattern seems no outline for the other cells. The black square in (3,1) and the gray circle in (3,2) don't have outlines, so the third entry should also follow this pattern (no outline).\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n8 (the large hexagon with black fill and no outline)\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3x3 grid with the bottom-right cell (3,3) missing.

But in row 3, the diamond is present instead of a triangle, and the outline pentagon is present.\nAlternatively, it could be the triangle, since triangle is in the first row, pentagon is in the second, and the diamond might connect conceptually with the square (by being a rotated square).\n</step_6>\nConsider the possibility that each row cycles through three shapes (triangle, pentagon, square), and the third shape in the third row must be the last in the sequence: triangle → pentagon → square (row 1: col 1, col 2, col 3), square → triangle → pentagon (row 2), pentagon → diamond → ??? (row 3).\nBut diamond = rotated square, so following the sequence, the missing cell should be a triangle (to complete the cyclic arrangement).\n</step_7>\nCompare answer options for triangles that match the outline/fill pattern of the third row: the pentagon is an outline (not filled), the diamond is light gray filled, so the last should be an outlined triangle (not filled).

Large light grey-filled circle.\n8. Light grey-filled circle.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLooking for patterns by rows: \n- First row: Shapes increase in number of sides (square=4, pentagon=5, hexagon=6), all filled grey.\n- Second row: Triangle (3 sides, filled), followed by a square (4 sides, not filled), then pentagon (5 sides, filled). The sequence by number of sides increases: 3, 4, 5. There is alternation in fill: filled, unfilled, filled.\n- Third row: Pentagon (5 sides, unfilled), hexagon (6 sides, unfilled), followed by the missing cell. Both are outlined only (not filled). The pattern in sides continues (5, 6, ...), so the missing shape probably should have 7 sides (heptagon), and should be outlined (unfilled).\n</step_2>\n<step_2>\nCheck the answer set for a 7-sided polygon (heptagon), outlined and not filled. \n- Answer 3 and 6 are pentagons (5 sides, light grey fill).\n- None of the other options appear to be a 7-sided polygon.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nNone of the answer options are a 7-sided polygon. Let's check for another possible pattern:\nSince the first row all shapes are filled, and go 4-5-6 sides.\nSecond row, sides: 3 (filled), 4 (unfilled), 5 (filled).\nThird row: 5 (unfilled), 6 (unfilled), ?; sides seem to increase, but only by one each time.\nThe only remaining polygon with 7 sides is missing in the answer set, so perhaps the correct shape should be the next logical option, a heptagon if present, or, otherwise, follow fill/unfill or shape alternation.\n</step_4>\nConsider other aspects: There is no circle in the problem matrix, but several in the answer set. Is one of the answer choices an unfilled 7-sided polygon? No. The only outlined shape is answer 1 (a rotated square, diamond), or 4 (outlined triangle).\n<step_5>\nIf we relax our rule to assume perhaps after hexagon comes circle (rounded shape), and since the other two in the last row are unfilled, perhaps the missing tile is an unfilled circle (answer 5).\nBut looking at the fill/unfill alternation (top filled, middle alternates, bottom unfilled), the last cell should be unfilled. Among circles in the answers, only answer 5 is a circle that is unfilled (the other circle answers are filled to varying degrees).\n</step_6>\nPerhaps the intention is that after the filled sequence (row 1), and the alternating sequence (row 2), the last row is all unfilled, sides increasing: 5, 6, ?. Since after hexagon comes circle as the continuous version with many sides—so circle (unfilled) is the plausible next step.\n</step_7>\nTherefore, answer 5 (unfilled circle) is the best fit for the missing cell.\n\n<correct_answer>\n5 (Unfilled circle)\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "Top row (from left to right): \n- First cell is a grey-filled square.\n- Second cell is a grey-filled pentagon.\n- Third cell is a grey-filled hexagon.", "score": 0.0, "num_mc_correct": 0, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Middle row (from left to right):\n- First cell is a grey-filled triangle (pointing down).\n- Second cell is an unfilled square (outlined only).\n- Third cell is a grey-filled pentagon.", "score": 0.0625, "num_mc_correct": 1, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Bottom row (from left to right):\n- First cell is an unfilled pentagon (outlined only).\n- Second cell is an unfilled hexagon (outlined only).\n- Third cell is missing (\"?\").", "score": 0.125, "num_mc_correct": 2, "num_mc_total": 16}, {"step": "Answer set at the bottom provides eight possible tiles:\n1.

Not revealing.\nLet's reaffirm the pattern:\nRow 1: triangle, square, circle\nRow 2: circle, triangle, diamond\nRow 3: square, circle, ?\n\nLooking at how shapes shift from one row to next:\nRow 1: triangle→square→circle\nRow 2: circle→triangle→diamond\nRow 3: square→circle→?\n\nFrom Row 1 to Row 2, the last shape in Row 1 moves to first of Row 2, middle shape moves to middle, and the first shape becomes a diamond in Row 2, third column (so, new shape).\nFrom Row 2 to Row 3, last shape (diamond) should move to first in Row 3, but instead it's a square, second shape (triangle) goes to become circle, etc. So perhaps the order cycles as: Row shifts the shapes right each time, introducing a new shape at the end—maybe the diamond is a new one.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nAlternatively, let's check the parallelism:\n- Each row uses three distinct geometric shapes (with no repetition in the same row). Each column: Column 1: triangle, circle, square. Column 2: square, triangle, circle. Column 3: circle, diamond, ?.\nThus, the missing cell in bottom right should have a new geometric shape not already in its row or column, or a shape present in one mirrored row. \nBut in 3rd column, shapes are: circle (row 1), diamond (row 2), so what unique shape is left that is not repeated in row 3 or column 3? Row 3 already has square (left), circle (middle). Thus, triangle or diamond? Since triangle is in the same row above (row 2, col 2), but diamond only appears in one cell.\nSquare is ruled out, as it's already in that row. Circle, already present too. So, a triangle is missing from row 3, column 3.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nCheck color/fill: Top row (outline or light gray), middle row (solid gray), bottom row (solid black). Thus, the missing triangle should be filled black, to match the color pattern.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nCheck the answer set: Among the options, which is a solid, black triangle? Option 7 is a solid black triangle, facing right.\n</step_8>\n<step_8>\nReview shape orientation: The triangles in previous rows both point downward and right, respectively. However, the missing cell pattern is less about orientation, more about having a triangle shape that is solid black.\n</step_9>\n<step_9>\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option 7: the solid, black triangle from the answer set.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 7: The solid, black triangle.\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3×3 grid with the bottom-right cell missing (\"?\").

None of the answers is a heptagon, but black circles are available in answer set. Column 3 in the first row is a hexagon (grey filled), in the second row it is a triangle (outline), so the shape sequence does not directly progress by number of sides.\nMost likely, the sequence resets to a basic shape, and the only options for a black-filled shape in the answers are circles.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nThere are three different sizes of black-filled circles (Answer Set 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Comparing the sizes of the shapes within the problem matrix, the missing tile should be similar in scale to the other shapes — not overly large or small.

Outlined medium pentagon\n8. Outlined triangle\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLook for horizontal (row-wise) or vertical (column-wise) patterns. Let's analyze the shapes in the first row: pentagon, square, triangle. These are three different geometric shapes (5, 4, and 3 sides, respectively), progressing in number of sides.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLook for fill/color patterns: \n- Row 1: all shapes are outlines except the square, which is filled gray.\n- Row 2: the left and center shapes are filled gray, the right shape is only an outline.\n- Row 3: filled black circle, filled black pentagon, missing.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nColumn-wise: \n- Column 1: pentagon outline, circle (gray), black circle\n- Column 2: gray square, gray pentagon, black pentagon\n- Column 3: triangle outline, pentagon outline, missing\nShapes are not the same per column, but color/fill pattern for columns 2 and 3 show a progression: gray → gray → black (col 2); outlines → outline → missing (col 3).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nFocusing on row 3: the progression is from a black-filled circle to a black-filled pentagon. The pattern could suggest an increase in the number of sides (from circle (infinite sides) to 5 sides (pentagon)), but actually it's going from a black circle (row 3, col 1) to a black pentagon (row 3, col 2). \nWhat comes next? Looking at row 1, it's pentagon → square → triangle.\nRow 2: circle → pentagon → pentagon outline.\nRow 3: circle → pentagon → ?\nSo following the progression from circle (row 3, col 1) to pentagon (row 3, col 2), in row 1, pentagon is followed by square and triangle, but those shapes aren't repeated in the third row so far.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nLook at columns:\n- Column 3: triangle outline (row 1), pentagon outline (row 2), missing tile (row 3). The pattern in column 3 is shapes with only black outlines and no fill. So the missing tile should be a shape with only an outline.\nFurther, row 3's shapes have black fill (solid).\nCompare with answer set: Out of the outline shapes, answer choices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are only outlines. 8 is a triangle outline.\nBut let's narrow it down further.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nLook for the exact pattern:\n- The first row: pentagon (row 1, col 1), triangle (row 1, col 3).\nRow 1: pentagon → square → triangle (from left to right: shapes lose sides: 5 → 4 → 3).\nRow 3: circle (infinite) → pentagon (5 sides) → ?\nPossibility: The shapes in a row either decrease in the number of sides, or follow a sequence. The missing shape after pentagon could be a square (4 sides).\nHowever, note that the triangle (row 1, col 3) is only an outline, and the pentagon in row 2, col 3 is also only an outline, matching the pattern of shapes with outlines only in column 3.\nThus, the missing tile should be a square with only an outline.\nIn the answer set, number 3 is a diamond (square rotated 45°), and none of the other options match a square outline, so 3 is the suitable candidate.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nCheck for consistency: Since column 3 has only outlined geometric shapes, and row 3 has had only black-filled shapes so far, but the anticipated pattern in column 3 takes precedence: in each column, the third shape is an outline-only version of the previous shapes. Thus, answer 3 (outlined diamond/square) best fills the pattern.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n3\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3x3 grid.

The correct answer should be hexagon, but since only empty heptagons are available, the next logical solution is that the intended pattern goes up by one for each next shape: square → pentagon → hexagon → heptagon.\nThus, for the third position, the answer should be the empty heptagon since that's the available logical continuation.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nAmong the answer choices, both 6 and 7 are empty heptagons.
