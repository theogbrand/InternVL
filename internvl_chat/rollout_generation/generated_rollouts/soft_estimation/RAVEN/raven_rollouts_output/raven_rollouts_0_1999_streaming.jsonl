Small dark gray circle.\n8. Gray circle.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet’s study the pattern across each row:\n- First row: change in shape (circle, square/diamond, pentagon), size (large), and color (gray/black/black).\n- Second row: change in shape (pentagon, circle, diamond), size (small), and color (gray/black).\n- Third row: square (outline), hexagon (gray), [missing].\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLet's examine the columns:\n- First column: large circle, small pentagon, square (outline).\n- Second column: black diamond, small gray circle, gray hexagon.\n- Third column: black pentagon, small black diamond, [missing].\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nAnalyzing row-wise:\n- Row 1: All filled, shapes: circle → diamond (rotated square) → pentagon. Each is filled in some dark shade.\n- Row 2: Shapes: pentagon → circle → diamond. Each is small, matching the large in row 1 (pentagon - row 1, col 3; circle - row 1, col 1; diamond - row 1, col 2).\n- Row 3: Shapes: square → hexagon → [missing]. Sizes are small/normal (not large like row 1).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThere's a clear pattern: the first shape in row 2 (pentagon) comes from the third shape in row 1 (pentagon), but shrunk and lighter; the second shape in row 2 (circle) comes from the first shape in row 1 (circle), also shrunk and lighter. The third shape in row 2 (diamond) comes from the second shape in row 1 (diamond), again shrunk and black.\nSo, row 2 is a small/shrunk version of row 1's shape, sometimes lightened (pentagon and circle, but not diamond).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nRow 3's first cell: square outline. There is no square in row 1 or row 2, but a diamond (which is a rotated square). The second cell in row 3 is a hexagon, which hasn't appeared before.\nAre the shapes progressing by number of sides? Row 1: 1st column is a circle (infinite sides), 2nd is square/diamond (4 sides), 3rd is pentagon (5 sides).\nRow 3 so far: square (4 sides, but now in outline), hexagon (6 sides), so logically the third cell should be the next shape with more sides—likely a heptagon (7), but such an option is not in the answers. Alternatively, perhaps a circle (if the sequence loops), but more likely the progression is based on the pattern of shrinking/sizing.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nAlternately, let's review the columns:\n- Column 1: large circle (row 1), small pentagon (row 2), square outline (row 3).\n- Column 2: black diamond (row 1), small gray circle (row 2), gray hexagon (row 3).\n- Column 3: black pentagon (row 1), small black diamond (row 2), [missing].\nFor column 3: the logic might be — shapes progress so: pentagon, diamond, [missing].\nBut what is common: row 1 (shaded shape), row 2 (smaller, black), row 3 (outline or gray/on light fill).\nRow 3 for col 3 should have a new shape in the sequence, possibly relating to the previous shapes' transformation.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nLet's focus on the third row itself:\n- Row 3, col 1: square outline (suggests transformation into an outline version).\n- Row 3, col 2: gray hexagon (filled, no outline).\n- Third shape, to follow: comparing to what happens in rows 1 and 2, there is a rotation: row 1 — circle, diamond, pentagon; row 2 — pentagon, circle, diamond. So, the elements rotate left by 1 each row. If row 3 continues, we expect diamond, pentagon, circle. But currently, it's square, hexagon, [missing].\nAlternatively, the hexagon is new, suggesting a moving sequence of sides upwards (square, pentagon, hexagon), so the answer for cell 3 should be a heptagon outline or filled, but none are among the options. The closest is circle or pentagon in various forms.\n</step_8>\n<step_8>\nLook at the colors:\n- Row 1: filled shapes, increasingly darker.\n- Row 2: small, mostly gray or black, matching the shape from above but color swapped.\n- Row 3: outline (square), filled (gray hexagon), then possibly another outline or filled shape with even more sides.\nLook at the answer set: Among all options, only option 4 is a gray hexagon (row 3, col 2), option 6 is a small outline pentagon.\nIf following the sequence: square → pentagon → hexagon, the skipped shape is a pentagon (row 3, col 2). However, row 3, col 2 is hexagon, so next may be a heptagon, but not available.\nAlternatively, the sequence on row 3 is 4 sides (square), 6 sides (hexagon), the next should be a shape with more sides — but the only shapes available in answers are variations of circle, pentagon, and hexagon. Pentagons appear only as option 6.\nGiven that the shapes in row 3 are increasing their number of sides by two each cell (4, 6, so 8 would be the next, but not available), perhaps they cycle back and use available shapes. But, more likely, pattern matches: square → pentagon → hexagon, meaning the second cell (hexagon) is a mismatch. But perhaps row 3 list shapes not present in other rows, i.e., square and hexagon both do not appear elsewhere.\n</step_9>\n<step_9>\nSummary: The row 3 pattern seems to be shapes not present in either row 1 or 2 at that column, as square is not in column 1 elsewhere, hexagon is not in column 2 elsewhere. So column 3 for row 3 should have a shape not present in column 3 of previous rows. Column 3, row 1: pentagon; row 2: diamond; so the remaining main basic shape is circle or square.\nOf the answer set, option 3 and option 5 provide a small gray circle; option 7, dark small circle; option 8, gray circle.

The pentagons are at the ends, and the square is in the middle, but rotated as a diamond.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nSecond row: \n- Square → Pentagon → Hexagon.\nThere is an increase in the number of sides as one moves right: 4 (square) → 5 (pentagon) → 6 (hexagon).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThird row: \n- Pentagon → Pentagon (darker and smaller) → ?\nFollowing the established pattern in the second row (incrementing sides) and the first row (pentagons at edges, square in the middle), and cross-checking, it appears likely that the number of sides should increase, or a square should appear.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow look at the vertical (columns):\nColumn 1: Pentagon, Square, Pentagon (all large-ish, gray, or dark gray, all have black borders).\nColumn 2: Square (diamond), Pentagon, Pentagon (all medium or small, two pentagons stacked, diamond at top).\nColumn 3: Pentagon, Hexagon, ?\nThe third column seems to be increasing the number of sides (5 → 6 → ?), so the logical next progression would be a 7-sided shape (heptagon). However, none of the answer choices is a heptagon.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nGiven the lack of a heptagon, look for another logical consistency. In all answers, only pentagons and squares are present as answer choices. The rows may use shapes not seen in the columns and/or vice versa.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nLet’s see if color or size could be a determining factor. In the last row, the first is a large, rotated gray pentagon; the second is a smaller, black pentagon; the logical progression may be to a square, as in previous rows where square-pentagon-hexagon occurs row-wise, perhaps continuing the alternation. However, that would have the forms:\nRow 1: Pentagon-Square-Pentagon\nRow 2: Square-Pentagon-Hexagon\nRow 3: Pentagon-Pentagon-?\nThe only shape not yet represented in row 3 is \"square\", so likely the answer is a square of some sort.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nNow, check the answer choices for a square of suitable size and shade. Since the row appears to have descending sizes (large pentagon, smaller pentagon), the third one should be the next smallest or largest, or continue the trend (which is descending size: large to medium to small).\nAvailable small square answer choices: \n- 2 (small, gray, outlined)\n- 8 (small, black, outlined)\nThe other square answers are not as small and don't match the descending size sequence.\nThe only black shape in the row is the middle one — the missing one could be black to keep the same color alternation.

In each row and column, the polygons are different, but sometimes repeat the number of sides. The first row has a heptagon and pentagon; the second row has pentagon and hexagon; the third row has a heptagon. Let's see if it’s a repetition of the polygons from above.\nLooking at the third column: pentagon (row 1), circle (row 2), missing (row 3). So perhaps the missing shape is a polygon with a different number of sides than those present in this row and column.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nSince the center in the third row is a heptagon, and the left is a circle, the right should be a pentagon or hexagon to fit the patterns above.\nBut both the first row and the second row contain pentagons and hexagons, with pentagons more dominant in this position (third column).\nThe shading pattern in the third column is: light gray (polygon), dark gray (circle), so expecting perhaps a polygon with a different shading.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nLooking more closely, in each row, the polygon type shifts right.

The square row (row 2) uses the same color in all three. So, the third row should use the same color triangle as the first two in that row, but the second triangle is slightly darker. \nHowever, in the answer set, only option 1 and option 6 match the color/fill of the first third-row triangle, with option 2 matching the second. To continue the row's color consistency pattern, the third triangle should use a similar color, likely matching the style of options 1 or 2 (since option 6 is a differently rotated version).\n</step_8>\nGiven that the color of the shapes in each row does not change and the primary transformation in the third row is rotation, and comparing triangle orientations in the answer set, option 2 fits as the third triangle, since it's the same style of triangle, but the orientation is rotated compared to the previous two to complete the pattern (rotating the triangle around).\n</step_9>\nConfirm that none of the other answer choices (4, 5, 7, or 8) follow the triangle style or complete the pattern of the third row.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\n2\n</correct_answer>", "steps_with_score": [{"step": "The problem matrix is a 3x3 grid.

In this column, we’ve had light gray and medium gray; to keep the color progression, the next likely step is dark gray (as in col 1, row 3, the circle is dark gray, so perhaps the pattern cycles through white, light gray, medium gray, dark gray).\n- Alternatively, if we track rows: in row 3, we have: dark gray (circle), light gray (pentagon), so the missing heptagon could be medium gray.\n- But looking at the exact pattern: In columns 1 and 2, the third (bottom) row features the darkest color of the shape in that column:\n   - Col 1: Heptagon (light) → Pentagon (white) → Circle (dark)\n   - Col 2: Circle (medium) → Heptagon (light) → Pentagon (light)\nThus, perhaps every shape that moves to a new shape in the last row is the darkest version of that shape so far.\nBut the medium color is used for circles when they occupy the 2nd or 3rd column; is this happening for polygons?\n</step_6>\n\n<step_6>\nLet’s check the shape matches in the answer set:\n- We need a heptagon (7 sides), and it possibly should be a medium or dark gray.\nFrom answer options:\n1.

is a pentagon, smaller and darker than the middle.\n- The bottom row left and middle have not changed from the second row (circle, pentagon), so it stands to reason that the missing tile in the right should echo the change seen in the row above: another pentagon, same size/darker than the one in the middle cell.\n</step_3>\n<step_3>\nNow, let's look at the column pattern:\n- Third column: top row is a small filled triangle (different shape, cannot compare much).\n- Second row: pentagon, darker and smaller than middle cell.\n- So in the third row, by analogy, the right cell will again be a pentagon, darker than the middle, maybe even darker than second row right cell.\n</step_4>\n<step_4>\nSo, the answer must be a pentagon, same size as the second and third row's middle/right cells, but with a darker fill than the middle cell of the same row (matching the trend from the second row).\nComparing answer choices, number 8 is a pentagon with the darkest fill among the options, matching

The images in each row and column contain geometric shapes: squares on the first row, circles on the second, triangles on the third. Shades of the shapes change in each row. The first two rows have increasing intensity: first row (square) goes from white to light gray, second row (circle) goes from black to dark gray. The missing tile is in the third row, third column.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nThe third row displays triangles pointing downward. The leftmost (row 3, col 1) is a thin outlined triangle; the middle (row 3, col 2) is a gray-filled triangle. The missing tile (row 3, col 3) should complete the sequence.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe answer set provides eight options: 1 is an outlined square, 2 is a filled black downward triangle, 3 is a pentagon outline, 4 is a hexagon outline, 5/6/7 are outlined downward triangles in different sizes, 8 is a circle outline.\n</step_3>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nFirst, identify the pattern in shading across columns in each row. Row 1: left to right—the square gets lighter (medium gray to lightest gray). Row 2: the circle gets lighter (from black to dark gray).

Medium gray filled downward triangle,\n8. Small gray filled downward triangle.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's look at the pattern horizontally and vertically to find the governing rule. \nIn the first row, each tile is a different shape: triangle, pentagon, square. Their shadings differ: black filled, gray outline, medium filled gray.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nIn the second row: diamond (filled black), triangle (outline), pentagon (filled black). The only thing similar between some rows/columns seems to be that each row contains one pentagon, one triangle (or triangle-like), and one square/diamond (polygonal with 4 sides).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThird row: pentagon (gray outline), square (gray filled), missing tile. So following the rows, the missing tile should be a triangle to complete the set in row 3.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nNow, let's check the shading logic. In row 3: pentagon (gray outline), square (gray filled)—the tone is gray, and the filling alternates from outline to filled. Thus, the triangle probably should be outline or filled gray.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nChecking the position in the columns: Column 1: triangle (filled black), diamond (filled black), pentagon (gray outline). Column 2: pentagon (gray outline), triangle (outline), square (gray filled).

Very light gray heptagon.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's analyze the pattern by rows:\n- Row 1: square, hexagon, triangle\n- Row 2: hexagon, triangle, diamond (rotated square)\n- Row 3: triangle, diamond, ?\n\nIt appears that the shape in each row moves through a cycle where the left tile's shape is echoed, rotated, or transformed in the next two columns. Both squares and diamonds are the same shape but at different orientations; triangles are present in all rows but change shade and orientation.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLet’s look for other patterns: \n- Each row uses a set of three shapes: square (diamond), hexagon, triangle.\n- Moving from top to bottom, each shape present in a row also shows up in the next row but in a different position and/or orientation/shade.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLet’s try analyzing the columns:\n- Column 1: square, hexagon, triangle\n- Column 2: hexagon, triangle, diamond\n- Column 3: triangle, diamond, ?\n\nWith this, it seems each column also moves: square → hexagon → triangle → diamond. \nIf column 3 must continue, it needs the next shape after diamond.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nBut since only three distinct shapes are used (square/diamond, hexagon, triangle), and since the diamond is just a rotated square, the cycle may restart.\n\nLet’s check color/shading pattern:\n- First column, top-down: medium gray, black, dark gray.\n- Second column: medium gray, light gray, black.\n- Third column: black, medium gray, ?\n\nIt seems the shades cycle through medium gray, black, dark gray, light gray, but not in the same order each row or column. \nHowever, the shape cycle is clearer than the color cycle.\n\nWhat is missing in the bottom right (third row, third column)?\n- The shape sequence for each row is: shape A, shape B, shape C. By referencing the diagonals, every potential row uses each of the three possible shapes (triangle, hexagon, diamond/square).\n- Row 3 already has: triangle (col 1), diamond (col 2), so column 3 should be the 'hexagon' for row 3.\n\nSo, the missing tile in row 3/column 3 is a hexagon.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nNow, what about color?\nLooking at the diagonal and horizontal distribution, shade is less regular, but let's see row 1 and 2:\n- Top right triangle is black, middle right is medium gray diamond, so bottom right could be dark or light, but most importantly, it must be a hexagon.\nNow compare with the given candidates.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nFrom the answer set, options 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 are all hexagons of various shades.\nIn row 2, the hexagon is solid black; in row 1, it’s medium gray.\nThe diamonds are medium gray (middle right) and black (bottom middle).\nThe triangle in the first column is dark gray; in the middle row, it's light gray.\n\nTo complete the color cycle, the only shade not already present in the row or column would be the lighter gray hexagon:\n- In the third row, we have dark gray triangle, black diamond; choosing a medium or lighter gray hexagon would fit best.\nAmong the candidates, #5 (medium gray hexagon) visually matches the shade used for the hexagon in row 1/column 2 and the square in row 1/column 1.
