Outlined pentagon, medium-dark fill\n7. Outlined triangle, light grey fill\n8. Outlined circle, light grey fill\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nExamine the rows and columns for rules. Each row seems to involve alternating between pentagons (row 1, col 1 and 2), and then a new shape appears in last position (diamond in row 1, col 3).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nIn the first column, first row is a dark pentagon; second row is a dark circle; third row is a darker circle (more filled? same color as pentagon). The first column thus alternates shapes (pentagon, circle, circle), possibly with color pattern (dark fill).\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nSecond column: first row is outlined pentagon, second row is outlined pentagon (filled), third row is outlined pentagon (medium fill). All are pentagons, but their fill shade seems to get darker from row 2 to 3.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThird column: top cell is dark diamond; middle is outlined pentagon (lightest fill); bottom is missing. Column seems to showcase \"different shape\" vs. previous pentagons and circles.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow check the diagonals: top-left to bottom-right: dark pentagon, outlined pentagon (middle), missing. Top-right to bottom-left: dark diamond, outlined pentagon, dark circle.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nCheck for progressions: \n- In each row, row 2: circle (filled), pentagon (medium), pentagon (light).\n- In row 3: dark circle, outlined pentagon (medium-dark). By pattern, the next shape could be a lighter pentagon or a new shape analogous to top row's diamond.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nNow, in the columns: \n- First column goes: pentagon (dark filled), circle (mid filled), circle (dark filled). \n- Second column: outlined pentagon (no fill), outlined pentagon (medium fill), outlined pentagon (darker fill).\n- Third column: diamond (dark filled), pentagon (light fill), missing.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nThe variable elements are shape (pentagon, circle, diamond), outline/fill (outlined or filled), and shade (light, medium, dark). The first row: shapes transition from pentagon to diamond. Middle row: transitions pentagon (mid) to pentagon (light). Bottom row: circle (dark), pentagon (medium-dark), ???— which suggests a parallel shift as in the top row. If pattern matches, the third cell in the third row should be a new shape, likely not a pentagon or a circle, and of a shade corresponding to the previous pattern (the diamond in top row 3 matches the pentagon in top row 1 in shade).\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nTop-right cell is a dark diamond and top-left is a dark pentagon. So, in third row, start with dark circle, mid is a pentagon, then a \"dark\" version of a new shape— paralleling the row 1 change. Looking at answer set, only shape not seen in the matrix and present among candidates is the triangle (option 7).\n</step_9>\n<step_10>\nMatching shade: since the transition is from dark filled (first cell) to shape change (third cell) in both row 1 and row 3, the triangle in the answer set (option 7) is light-grey not dark, but it's the only new shape (not circle, pentagon, or diamond). The closest pattern is introducing a new shape paralleling the diamond in row 1.

However, that is already the first cell of the third row.\n- Comparing with the first row, perhaps the missing piece should be the solid black pentagon, since the first row has: solid black → outlined → shaded/outlined.

Both shape and color/fill seem to rotate.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nLet's try to determine the missing shape:\nLooking at rows 1 and 2:\n- Row pattern: 1. Triangle → Pentagon → Circle; 2. Circle → Triangle → Hexagon; 3. Hexagon → Circle → ?\nSo the pattern is shifting left each row.\nThus, the missing shape is the shape that comes after circle in the established pattern. Looking at the patterns: Triangle, Pentagon, Circle, Hexagon.\n- Row 1: Triangle, Pentagon, Circle\n- Row 2: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon\n- Row 3: Hexagon, Circle, ?\nThus, the answer is Pentagon.\nBut among the answer set, the only pentagon is not present. So let's check again.\n</step_6>\n<step_6>\nNow let's check: In both the first and second rows, each row contains three different shapes, and in all, the triangle appears once, pentagon once, circle once, hexagon once in each pair. If I treat it as a cycle: triangle, pentagon, circle, hexagon, etc.\nRow 1: triangle, pentagon, circle\nRow 2: circle, triangle, hexagon\nRow 3: hexagon, circle, ?\nSo the missing shape is pentagon to complete three unique shapes in a row, but pentagon does not appear in the answer set!\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nLet's try a different tack: colors have a cycle. In each row, there is (grey or black) fill, outline, and another fill (light or dark). In each column: the first column is filled, filled, filled; second column: outline, filled, filled; third column: outline, outline, ?. The missing place is in the bottom right, so it should be an outline, based on this visible pattern.\n</step_8>\n<step_8>\nLooking at the answer set, the only possible outlines are answers 1 (outline triangle), 2 (outline hexagon), 3 (outline square), 4 (outline triangle left), 6 (outline triangle right), and 8 (outline circle). Of these, only outline hexagon (2) hasn't been used yet in the third column. Alternately, look at the actual shapes:\n- Third column: Row 1: outline circle, Row 2: outline hexagon, so Row 3: outline triangle (as the set rotates).\nDo we have an outline triangle in the options? Yes: 1, 4, 6.\nLooking at the orientation: Row 1 triangle points left, but is solid; Row 2 triangle points up, is solid; So perhaps orientation isn't constant, but in the answer set, 1 points left, 4 points left (bold), 6 points right. The most likely is the outline triangle with correct fill/orientation.\nRow-3, col-3: as per the sequence, outline triangle.

Both 6 and 8 match the requirement (light filled circle). Either could theoretically be correct, but option 6 is positioned earlier and follows the visual pattern more closely.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}], "question": "You are an abstract reasoning puzzle expert. The puzzle you will receive is presented in a standard Raven's Progressive Matrices format: a 3×3 matrix of related images, with the bottom-right cell (the ninth tile) missing. There are eight possible answer choices provided separately, and your task is to decide which of those eight images correctly completes the 3×3 matrix pattern.\n\nI will provide you with an image containing:\n- Problem Matrix: An accompanying image that shows the eight tiles and highlights where the ninth is missing.\n- Answer Set: The eight candidate images from which you must choose the best fit for the missing tile.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Review the problem matrix and the accompanying image in sequence, describing step-by-step what you see in the image in <perception> tags.\n- Reason step-by-step about the logical pattern or rule connecting the tiles in <reasoning> tags.\n- Deduce the correct tile from the eight provided options in <correct_answer> tags.\n\nIt is crucial that your solution contains these sections in the exact format described below:\n\n```\n[Perception]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_n>\n...(Step n of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_n>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_m>\n...(Step m of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_m>\n\n<correct_answer>\n...(Clearly state which of the 8 candidate images is the best candidate image as the missing tile to complete the matrix. If the candidates are numbered, lettered, or can be uniquely described, use that identifier.)...\n</correct_answer>\n```\n"}
