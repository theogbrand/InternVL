The first column (left): an upside-down triangle (outline), a rotated dark gray hexagon, a rotated dark gray hexagon. The second column: a square (outlined with gray fill), a non-rotated light gray hexagon, a non-rotated light gray hexagon.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nNotice that from row 2 to row 3, the middle and left hexagons are identical in shape (row 2 and 3): the first is a rotated dark gray hexagon, the next is a non-rotated light gray hexagon, and these same hexagons appear in both row 2 and row 3, columns 1 and 2.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nColumn 3, row 1: a polygon (pentagon) with gray fill and black outline; row 2: solid black circle; row 3: missing.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nIt appears that in each row, the shapes become progressively more complex or more \"regular\": triangle, square, pentagon (row 1); then in row 2, all hexagons and then a circle. In row 3, the hexagons are repeated, so the last should be related to the black circle in row 2, column 3.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nLooking at the color patterns: the transition in the second row to the third row is repetition for the first two columns. The last column in row 2 is a solid black circle. For consistency, the last column in row 3 should also be a solid black circle.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nFrom the answer set, option 2, 4, or 6 matches the shape/solid fill of the black circle, but all are identical. Among these, any would technically fit, but the size of the circle in row 2, column 3 matches the size of option 2, 4, and 6, which are all identical.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nThus, the correct answer is option 2 (solid black circle).\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n2 (the solid black circle)\n</correct_answer>\n",

They all have a centered square except candidate 6, which is a black circle. The squares vary in color: candidate 1 and 5 have a medium gray, candidate 2 is a dark gray, candidate 3 is black, candidate 4 is blacker, candidate 7 is also medium gray, and candidate 8 is blackest.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nObserve the pattern in each row.

However, reviewing the pattern in the matrix, the last step is from gray to black; there is no indication the actual last square should be \"blacker\" than black (might be just another black due to display).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nCandidates 1, 5, and 7 are medium gray, so would repeat the first square. Candidate 2 is an intermediate dark gray. Candidate 3 is black, which matches the natural progression from gray to black. Candidate 4 and 8 are visually indistinguishable from candidate 3 but may just be alternative displays of black. Candidate 6 is a circle, not a square, so is immediately disqualified.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nSince row progressions move from outline/light/dark, and the row above the missing square ends on black, the best consistent match is the completely filled black square: candidate 3 (or possibly candidate 4/8 if there's a print issue, but candidate 3 is the standard pure black).\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n3\n</correct_answer>",

In the second row, the same progression, but shifted left: circle → hexagon → square. Third row: hexagon → diamond → ?\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThere is a clear progression:\n- In each row, the shapes are being shifted left.\n  - Row 1: square → circle → hexagon\n  - Row 2: circle → hexagon → square\n  - Row 3: hexagon → diamond → ?\nSo, the missing shape must be the next in the sequence after diamond; since in prior rows, the shape from cell 1 moves to cell 2, cell 2 to cell 3, cell 3 wraps to cell 1.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nLooking at the sequence: first row: square → circle → hexagon; then circle → hexagon → square; then hexagon → diamond → ?\nThe new shape after square is diamond. In the third row: hexagon → diamond → [the next shape]. So, what comes after diamond? Let's see if there's a rule.\nIn the first row, it's always increasing by 1 side: square (4 sides), circle (infinite), hexagon (6 sides). But that doesn't fit.\nAlternatively, perhaps the shapes are: square (4), circle (0 edges), hexagon (6), diamond (4 sides but rotated). It's likely that the sequence is cycling as per positions.\nAlternatively, let's look at the shading pattern.\n- Color: First row: Black → Dark gray → Medium gray\n- Second row: Dark gray → Medium gray → Light gray (outlined)\n- Third row: Dark gray → Medium gray → ?\n\nThe shading in each row goes from darkest to lighter.\nSo following that, the final cell in the third row should have the lightest shade compatible with the row and the previous pattern.\n\nFinally, notice that the last figure in row 1 is a hexagon, row 2 is a square (rotated 0°), so the last figure in row 3 should be circle, since in previous row shifts, after diamond comes circle.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nThus, the sequence seems to shift left, meaning following the row: hexagon (shifted from previous row's third), diamond (shifted from first row's first), and now, the third shape should be the shape that was in the first row's second column: circle.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nLooking at the shading, in the row: hexagon (dark gray), diamond (medium gray), so the next should be light gray, as in the other rows.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nNow, let's check the answer set for a light gray circle with black outline: This corresponds to option 5 in the answer set.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 5: The light gray circle with a black outline is the best candidate to complete the matrix.\n</correct_answer>",

This matches with leftward shifting of shapes.\n\nSo, after diamond, what comes next in the cycle? If we look at the diagonal, top left to bottom right: square, hexagon, ?\n\nShapes in order: square (1), circle (2), hexagon (3), diamond (4), so after diamond would repeat to square or cycle, but the pattern suggests that the third shape should be a circle.\n\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nNow, shade analysis: \n- The bottom row has: dark hexagon (left), medium gray diamond (middle), and the last one should most likely be light gray, based on the sequence of shading: dark → medium → light.\nIn the corresponding position in the second row, the shape has a light gray outline fill (the square in the third column, row 2).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow, check the options for a circle with a light-gray fill and thin outline.

Outlined circle (unfilled)\n8. Small solid gray circle\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's analyze the pattern by rows and columns. Looking across the first row: the shapes are square, circle, hexagon -- each row appears to progress in the number of sides/complexity: 4 sides, circle (infinite sides), 6 sides.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nHowever, if we compare the shapes in each row:\n- First row: Square, circle, hexagon\n- Second row: Circle, hexagon, square\n- Third row: Hexagon, diamond, ?\n\nIt appears that in each row, the shape is shifted one position to the left from the row above (sequence: square, circle, hexagon → circle, hexagon, square → hexagon, square, ?). However, instead of a square in the third row, second column, it's a diamond (which is a rotated square). So the diamond represents a square rotated.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nColors/shading cycles: First row moves from black to dark gray to light gray. Second row moves from medium gray to gray to light gray outline. Third row moves from dark gray to gray to ?\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nChecking columns:\n- First column: Square (black), Circle (medium gray), Hexagon (dark gray)\n- Second column: Circle (gray), Hexagon (gray), Diamond (gray)\n- Third column: Hexagon (light gray), Square (light gray outline), ?\n\nLooking at the diagonal movement of both shapes and shades: the shapes seem to rotate in each row, each moving left. The color sequence seems less regular, but the second and third columns in the first two rows both feature the same fill for their shape (gray, gray; light gray, light gray outline).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nIf we continue the shape cycle: square → circle → hexagon → square (next would be square, but that position is the diamond, a rotated square). So for the missing cell (row 3, column 3), following the pattern would give us a circle (since the pattern loops: square, circle, hexagon). Based on the first two rows' last cell specifically: hexagon, square (outline), expect circle.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nFor shading/fill: the first row is all solid shapes, the second row has a mix, and the third row is solid hexagon, solid diamond, so the missing one should probably also be solid.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nAmong the answer options, the only solid circle is #5 (large light gray filled circle), but #6 and #8 are also circles of different sizes and fills/shades. Comparing the sizes, the filled circles in the matrix are of standard size, so the matching filled circle of similar size to others is #5.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nTherefore, the answer is #5: the light gray filled circle.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\n5\n</correct_answer>\n",

So for the third row, the number needed for the third cell could be 6 (following 5, 4, and then 6 as a repeating sequence found in the columns).\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nAlso notice: In row 3, the sequence is pentagon (5 sides, hollow), diamond (rhombus, 4 sides, filled), so the next would complete the set with a polygon with 6 sides (hexagon) and, if following the filling sequence, the missing should be hollow/outlined (since row 3 alternates hollow, filled, hollow).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nChecking the answer set: The only answer that is a hollow hexagon (6-sided) is number 7.\n</step_8>\n\n<correct_answer>\n7 (The hollow hexagon) is the best candidate image to complete the matrix.\n</correct_answer>\n",

Vertically, the first column: diamond, triangle, hexagon (sides: 4, 3, 6).

The only consistent progression is that the shape's sides increase by 1 moving left to right in rows 1 and 2.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nIn the bottom row, both cells so far are hexagons, but with different fill shades. The only answer tile not a circle is tile 8 (a square). However, the pattern for the third row's missing tile is likely to suggest progression or repetition of adding sides.\nIt appears that as the rows progress, the row starts with a shape then the next cell is one side more, and so on.\nHowever, the third row begins with a hexagon and is followed by another hexagon, suggesting a possible break in the pattern. The only way to continue would be by increasing sides to a heptagon (7 sides), but there is no such shape in the answer choices; all provided answer choices are circles except tile 8 (a square/diamond shape).\n</step_7>\nGiven the provided answer options, and the logical progression exhausted (since a heptagon is not present), examine visual matching: The only available polygon in the answer set is option 8 (a black square). All other options are circles, which do not match the visual theme of the matrix (which is about polygons and increasing sides, not circles).\n</step_8>\nLogically, since the shapes advance from triangle (3), diamond/square (4), pentagon (5), hexagon (6), the next polygon would have more sides, but in the absence of a heptagon or related shape in the answer set, the puzzle likely expects the only non-circle option, as a direct visual analogy to the most recent similar shapes (polygons).\n</step_9>\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 8 (the black square), as the only polygonal (non-circular) choice.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 8 (the black square) is the best candidate image to complete the matrix.\n</correct_answer>",

Also, the shapes alternate between pentagons and circles, with the exception of the hexagon in the upper-right.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLet’s look at columns:\n- Column 1: black pentagon, gray pentagon, gray outlined circle.\n- Column 2: gray circle, black pentagon, gray pentagon.\n- Column 3: dark gray hexagon, large gray circle, missing.\nColumns and rows do not maintain one strict progression but seem to rotate or evolve shape, color, and size.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nFrom the first two columns of the third row: circle, pentagon, (?). In the first two rows of the third column: hexagon, circle, (?).\nPattern: The first row in each column has a different shape, and row 3 seems to restart the sequence.\n- In the first and second rows, every row contains a pentagon and a circle (the third shape in each is either a hexagon or a circle).\n- In the third row, we have a circle, then a pentagon, then the missing piece.\nIt appears that after the circle and the pentagon, the next progressive shape should be a hexagon, matching the evolution seen in the first row.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nJudging by color and fill: the top-right cell is a dark gray hexagon (row 1, col 3). The corresponding row 2, col 3 cell is a large gray circle. Thus, the shape in row 3, col 3 should likely be a hexagon, matching the set, and the shading should be dark (like the adjacent pentagon) and/or black (since the other third-column shape is dark gray), but size is probably similar to those in the answer set.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nFrom the answer set, only option 5 shows a black hexagon. The other options are pentagons (1,2,4,7,8), a square (3), and a triangle (6).\nTherefore, option 5 is a black hexagon, which fits the expected evolution based on shape and color patterns.\n</step_6>\n\n<correct_answer>\n5\n</correct_answer>",

Their colors alternate (solid—white outline—solid).\nMiddle row: All are pentagons. There is a gradient: light gray outline → medium gray filled → black filled.\nBottom row: All are triangles. Left is gray filled, middle is black filled, and right is missing.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nColumn-wise: each column features the same shape, but changes color.

In triangles, left is gray, middle is black, so the right may either be an outlined triangle (completing a sequence: gray→black→outline), or perhaps another repeat of the first—looking at the top row, the third is identical to the first.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nUpon closer inspection, the sequence for each row is: \n- Top row: black filled, white outline, black filled\n- Middle row: outline, filled, black filled\n- Bottom row: gray filled, black filled, ?\nSo, the third should be a gray filled (copying top row's structure), but that would simply repeat the first triangle.\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle sequence is: gray → black → gray (mirroring the top row). Checking the answer set, option 7 is identical to the first triangle. Therefore, option 7 matches the first triangle and completes the repeated pattern.\n</step_4>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 7 (the gray-filled triangle), as it matches the pattern of repeating the first tile in the third location for both the first and third rows.\n</correct_answer>\n",

In previous columns, both outlined and filled shapes are used, but each row in the third column seems to follow a \"filled, filled, outlined\" pattern in some sequences; a precise shading pattern by column is not strict.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nChecking the rows: third row (bottom row) has black filled circle (left), outlined gray pentagon (middle), thus the right position (missing) must be a triangle to complete the set.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nSummarize: the missing shape is a triangle, its orientation should match the triangle in the same row or column in other instances, and ideally the shading follows the fill patterns from parallel positions.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nInspecting potential matching triangle options in answers: \n- Options 1–5 are all triangles, but all are pointing left, none upwards or downwards.\n- Option 3 is filled medium gray.\n- Option 8 is black filled.\n- Option 1 is leftward, outlined.\n- Option 2 is leftward, but a slightly lighter fill.\nThe only non-left-pointing triangles in the matrix are upward or downward (but not in the answer set).\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nSince all triangle choices are left-pointing in the answer set, the pattern must accept a left-pointing triangle, indicating that the crucial variable is shape and shading, not orientation. In the third column, the sequence goes: gray filled, black filled, so the final triangle should fit the next logical shading step (possibly dark gray filled).\n</step_9>\n<step_10>\nIn the third row, the other shapes are black filled (circle) and gray outlined (pentagon), so a filled triangle, ideally a dark fill to \"complete\" the spectrum, makes the most sense.

Options 1-5 are triangles, 6 is a square, 7 a dark gray circle, and 8 a solid black triangle.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet's analyze the columns:\n- 1st column: pentagon (dark gray), triangle (light gray), circle (black)\n- 2nd column: triangle (inverted, white), circle (gray), pentagon (outline, gray)\n- 3rd column: circle (gray), pentagon (black), [missing]\nSo, it seems each row and column contains a pentagon, a triangle, and a circle, but with different colors and orientations.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLet us analyze the shape sequence in each row and column. Each row contains: Row 1 (pentagon, triangle, circle), Row 2 (triangle, circle, pentagon), Row 3 (circle, pentagon, ?). So, the missing shape in Row 3 is a triangle.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nNext, let’s look at the color/shade pattern. In each row, all shapes have different colors (dark, light, black, outline). In the third row, we have: black circle, gray outlined pentagon, so the missing triangle should be filled (not outline), and should use the remaining color/shade that isn’t already used in the row or conflicting with above columns.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nNow, consider column 3: Row 1 (large gray circle), Row 2 (black pentagon), Row 3 (should be triangle). The triangle should be a dark shade, since the first two are gray and black, but black is already used in row 3.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nAlso, in column 2, we have: upside-down white triangle, gray circle, outlined pentagon. No dark shapes in this column. In column 1, dark pentagon, light triangle, black circle. So, each row and column includes three different colors (if possible).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nReviewing the answer options:\n- Options 1, 2: white/gray small left-pointing triangles (do not fit the size and style).\n- Options 3, 4, 5: right-pointing triangles of various shades, all filled.\n- Option 3: medium gray triangle.\n- Option 4: slightly darker triangle.\n- Option 5: left-pointing black triangle.\n- Option 6: square (doesn't fit).\n- Option 7: gray circle (already used).\n- Option 8: solid black right-pointing triangle.\n\nAmong options, Option 8 (solid black right-pointing triangle) seems promising. However, in Row 3, the black shade is already used for the circle, and in column 3 for the black pentagon. The triangle in Row 3/Col 3 should be medium/dark gray, but not black.\n</step_7>\n<step_7>\nIn Row 3, the existing shapes are: black circle, gray outlined pentagon. Using an all black triangle here would violate the pattern of unique shades within a row. The only appropriate dark filled triangle from the answer choices is Option 3 (medium gray solid triangle).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nAlso, the orientation of the triangle must be considered. All triangles in the matrix point upward except for the one in Row 1/Col 2 (which points down). In the last cell, it should point to the right to fit the visual pattern established in the answer set.\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nOption 3 is a right-pointing, medium gray triangle, combining the correct color (not used in the same row or column for the triangle), fill (solid, not outline), and matches the directional/positional logic.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\n3\n</correct_answer>\n",

Outline downward triangle,\n8. Light gray circle (but with outline).\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLook for a pattern either by row or by column. Let's first consider rows.\nFirst row: All shapes are filled, color intensity increases left to right: light gray circle → medium gray diamond → black pentagon.\nSecond row: All shapes are solid or filled, but shapes are changing: pentagon → circle → square, and intensity: medium gray → black → light gray (decrease then increase in brightness).\nThird row: Square (black filled), outline pentagon (no fill), missing.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nAlternatively, examine columns:\nFirst column: Light gray circle → medium gray pentagon → black square.\nSecond column: Medium gray diamond → black circle → outline pentagon.\nThird column: Black pentagon → light gray square → ?\nColumns appear to decrease or change in both shape and color.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nConsider the sequence of shapes in rows or columns. \nFirst row: Circle, diamond, pentagon. \nSecond row: Pentagon, circle, square.\nThird row: Square, pentagon, ?\nThere is a shifting of shapes with each row and a rotation through the set of shapes.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nIf we look diagonally: top left is circle, center is black circle, bottom right should logically be a circle-related shape for symmetry, but let's test this systematically.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nIs there a color/pattern rule? First row: all filled, in varying shades: light gray, medium gray, black. \nSecond row: medium gray pentagon, black circle, light gray square. \nThird row: black square, outline pentagon, ?\nIf we expect an outline shape, that fits: first row all filled, second row filled, third row might be outline shapes (since center is outline only).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nPatterns in the third row:\n- First column: solid black square (matches third in first row, but different color).\n- Second column: outline pentagon (matches pentagon in row one and two).\nIt seems the pattern involves shape progression (square, pentagon, expected: circle/diamond?), and fill change (filled, outline, perhaps outline again?).\nFrom the pentagon shape sequence in the second column: diamond → circle → outline pentagon. So for the third row, the third figure should be an outline, possibly a diamond (since first row second column is a filled diamond, second row is a filled square).\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nLooking at the answer set, #7 is an outline triangle (which doesn’t fit), #2 is an outline pentagon (already used). Of the available options only #4 is a pure outline: a circle outline. \nFrom the shape sequence, especially since the circle is not present in the third row, and if we use progression logic for shape, the answer is likely #4 (outline circle). This is further supported by the idea that the third row converts from solid to outline.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n4 (Circle outline)\n</correct_answer>",

The first column is all circles, the second column is all pentagons, and the third column is all triangles. Thus, columns organize by shape.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nDown the rows: \n- First row: outlined, mid-to-light gray, regular orientation, large size;\n- Second row: filled black, the shapes are rotated (pentagon and triangle), large size;\n- Third row: filled dark (darker than row 1, lighter than row 2), smaller size, regular orientation.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nThe shading/fill pattern: \n- Row 1: outline, light gray\n- Row 2: filled, black\n- Row 3: filled, dark color (not fully black, slightly lighter), and smaller than the second row's.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nWithin the third row, the first two cells are dark, small, filled versions of a circle and a pentagon. The missing third cell in the third row must be a similarly small, dark, filled triangle.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nThe answer choices: Only the triangles need to be considered. Of the options, 5 and 8 are small, filled, black (actually dark), left-pointing triangles. Option 3 is a larger upright triangle, 1 and 6 are right-pointing, 4 is a left-pointing, but in a lighter shade.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nComparing the size, fill, and shade with the other two in the third row (circle and pentagon): The closest match for size and fill is answer 5 (small, left-pointing black triangle, same stroke weight and fill as the circle and pentagon.) Option 8 is also a left-pointing triangle, but it’s even smaller, and the shading might be a bit lighter. Option 5 is better matched in size/shade.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nConfirming: the triangle in the corresponding place in the first two rows is upright (outline, large, light gray) and right side up (filled, large, black). There is no strict orientation switching: the triangle's orientation changes by row (row 1: upside down, row 2: upright, row 3: left-pointing). However, in the \"small filled triangles\" of the answer set, option 5 is the best match.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n5\n</correct_answer>\n",

The shapes are a gray circle (1), an outline square (2), a gray square (3), a smaller gray square (4), an outlined triangle (5), a gray outlined square (6), a gray pentagon (7), and a gray hexagon (8).\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nLet’s look for patterns row-wise and column-wise, focusing on the geometric shape, fill (color), and possibly size.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nAcross each row, there seems to be a rotational or permutation pattern involving the three shapes: pentagon, diamond, triangle (first row), diamond, triangle, pentagon (second row), and triangle, pentagon, [missing] in the third row. Observing, the shapes cycle: pentagon → diamond → triangle → pentagon ... etc.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nChecking the columns for shapes: first column is pentagon, diamond, triangle; second column is diamond, triangle, pentagon; third column is triangle, pentagon, ?. So, both rows and columns are cycling among pentagon, diamond, triangle.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nLooking at the third column: Row 1 is triangle, Row 2 is pentagon, so Row 3 should be diamond/rhombus (to continue the sequence from previous rows and columns).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nNow, checking colors/fill. For the third column, the triangle is dark gray/black, the pentagon is black, so perhaps the missing shape, the diamond/rhombus, should be black as well.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nReviewing the answer set, is there a black diamond/rhombus? There isn’t, but option 3 and 4 are gray squares, which could be mistaken for diamonds, but they are not rotated. Examining further, none of the answer set options are diamonds/rhombuses or rotated squares; only squares, triangles, pentagons, and a hexagon and a circle.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nSince the diamond in the matrix is a rotated square, let's see if any candidate corresponds to a square that could be interpreted as a diamond if rotated. Option 3 (gray square) can become a diamond if rotated 45°, and it is filled with gray (similar to earlier).\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nOption 4 is a smaller square, gray as well, but size is less relevant, as in the matrix, size doesn't conclusively follow a pattern. Comparing options 3 and 4, option 3 best matches the fill and general size found earlier for the diamond shape (i.e., the large filled diamond in the matrix).\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nGiven the cycling pattern, the missing shape should be a diamond (square rotated 45°), and the only candidate that best fits is option 3.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\n3\n</correct_answer>",

The sequence in the other rows proceeds triangle → pentagon → diamond. The missing shape should therefore be diamond.\n- The color sequence in row 3 is black → dark gray → ?. Looking at the other rows, the colors in each row are permutations of gray, black, and dark gray. The only color not yet used in row 3 is light gray. Similar for column 3: colors are dark gray (row 1), black (row 2), so for row 3 it should be light gray.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nThe missing tile should be a diamond shape, colored light gray, outlined in black. Check the answer options for a light gray diamond: There is no light gray diamond option. However, Option 3 and 4 are light or medium gray squares, which look like diamonds when rotated. Compare against earlier rows: the diamonds have their vertices vertical/horizontal and look like squares rotated 45°.

However, none of the answer choices show an outlined, unfilled circle. The closest match is answer 3 (filled dark circle), but if we compare with the rest of the row patterns, the matrix alternates outlined and shaded fill, but never fully black.\nAlternatively, answer 6 (solid black circle) is not consistent with the rest of the fill patterns in the matrix. \nAnswer 8 best matches the size and fill of the filled grey circles in the second row, third column. And based on the progression (triangle outline, pentagon filled, circle?), the next logical step is an outlined circle (but since it's not available), the closest match by available options is the grey filled large circle, that is, answer 8.\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\n8 (Filled grey circle, large)\n</correct_answer>",

In row 1, the pentagons go from light to dark left to right. In row 3, pattern is not about shade evolution, but matching shapes: So, since the hexagon is medium, the blackest pentagon fits.\n</step_7>\n<step_8>\nFrom the answer set: Examine the pentagons.\n- 1: black pentagon\n- 2: light gray pentagon, outline only\n- 4: dark pentagon\n- 5: medium gray pentagon\n\nFrom the patterns, black is the logical fit as row 3's sequence is going medium-dark (hexagon) → black (circle) → black (pentagon).\n</step_8>\n<step_9>\nAmong the answer choices, answer 1 (black pentagon) fits shape and shade correctly with the expected pattern.\n</step_9>\n\n<correct_answer>\n1\n</correct_answer>\n",

Between them, both are black. Choice 7 also looks like a pentagon but is larger and overlaps the square substantially more than the other pentagons, making it less consistent with the size used in the matrix.\nHowever, answer choices 1 and 4 appear roughly identical and both fit.

Let's look at shape progression:\n- Row 1: pentagon, diamond, pentagon\n- Row 2: square, pentagon, hexagon\n- Row 3: pentagon, hexagon, ?\nIt appears the shape is changing or increasing by number of sides, or there's a progression in geometric complexity.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nNow, observe color and shape pattern:\n- In row 1: both pentagons are gray/black, and the diamond is black, suggesting alternating shapes/colors, but mainly two types: pentagon and diamond (which is a square rotated).\n- In row 2: shapes in this row are square, pentagon, hexagon — each seems to increase by one side from left to right (square 4 sides, pentagon 5, hexagon 6). Similarly, the color remains consistent within each shape.\n- In row 3: pentagon (5 sides), hexagon (6 sides), so the missing shape should ideally be a 7-sided figure if following the side progression. However, none of the answer shapes is a heptagon.\n</step_3>\n<step_3>\nCheck the columns for a pattern:\n- Column 1: pentagon, square, pentagon (row 1), square (row 2), pentagon (row 3)\n- Column 2: diamond, pentagon, hexagon (row 1), pentagon (row 2), hexagon (row 3)\nNot clearly consistent vertically; the main progression is horizontal (increasing number of sides).\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nIf no heptagon is present in the answer set, perhaps the pattern is to repeat the shape sequence but adjust color/size. Note that the answer set contains squares and one pentagon. The pentagon (Answer 7) matches the style of pentagons in the matrix, particularly the dark color and orientation like the lower-left pentagon.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nIf we look at the bottom row: dark gray pentagon, black hexagon, and a missing shape. The sequence in this row follows pentagon, hexagon, likely next would be a square if it loops or reverts, but the initial progression is by the number of sides, suggesting the next should be a heptagon (not available). The only available options are pentagon (7) and different colored/filled squares.\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nGiven the available options and the matrix's emphasis on pentagons in several positions, and the only shape in the answer set matching style/orientation/color is Answer 7, the gray pentagon.

These pentagons appear to be the same size and orientation as those in the row above but are rotated compared to the second row. The shades match the first two pentagons in the second row.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nThe answer set below provides eight candidate shapes: 1 (triangle, light gray), 2 (hexagon, medium/dark gray), 3 (heptagon, very dark gray), 4 (hexagon, lightest gray), 5 (diamond, light gray), 6 (heptagon, dark gray), 7 (circle, light gray), and 8 (pentagon, light grayish-medium).\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nAnalyze the pattern across rows and columns. The first row is three squares in different shades; the second row is three pentagons with the same three shades in the same left-to-right order. The third row starts with two pentagons matching the first two shades from the second row, but these are rotated, unlike the upright pentagons above.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nIt appears each row has the same shape, with the same sequence of shades, but the shape changes from row to row: first row = square, second row = upright pentagon, third row = rotated pentagon.

Medium, filled black diamond.\n</step_5>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nObserve the pattern in each row: \n- First row: large black diamond → medium dark gray diamond → small outline-only diamond.\n- Second row: large dark gray square → medium outline-only square → small filled black square.\n- Third row: large outline-only diamond → medium filled black diamond → ?\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nWithin each row, the shape stays consistent (all diamonds in the first row, all squares in the second, all diamonds in the third), the size decreases from left to right (large → medium → small), and the fill transitions from filled to outlined or vice versa.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nObserve the pattern in shading/fill:\n- Row 1: filled black → filled dark gray → outlined\n- Row 2: filled dark gray → outlined → filled black\n- Row 3: outlined → filled black → ?\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nFor the third row: Since the first cell is outlined, the second is filled black, the logical third should follow the previous sequences. In the first row, the sequence goes from filled → dark gray → outlined, so if we use this transition, the next would be a medium- or small-sized dark gray diamond (since we've already had outlined and black).\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nCompare with the answer set. Only options 3 and 5 provide a dark gray diamond (and both are large in size), but the pattern in the other rows is that the shape decreases in size from left to right (large→medium→small).\n</step_5>\n<step_6>\nHowever, none of the answer set options match a small or medium dark gray diamond exactly, but option 5 clearly has a dark gray diamond (albeit large), and option 3 is the same shape, also large, but this is consistent with the available options—the closest possible correct fill and shape. All other options either are not diamonds or are the wrong fill.\n</step_6>\n<step_7>\nBetween 3 and 5, both are large dark gray diamonds (which matches the expected fill, if not the exact size). There are two options (likely a redundancy); picking either of them is functionally correct for the rule, but since the shape and fill are correct, and we must choose, let's pick the earliest (option 3).\n</step_7>\n\n<correct_answer>\nOption 3 (large, filled dark gray diamond)\n</correct_answer>",

Let's see if there's link between number of sides:\n- Row 1: +1 sides each step.\n- Row 2: +1 (5→6→circle).\n- Row 3: 4 (square) → 6 (hexagon) → ? (Maybe 8? Octagon? Or perhaps a shape with more sides than hexagon, but none in the answer set.)\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nLet's check the color/outline pattern:\n- Row 1: all outline, white fill.\n- Row 2: all filled, from light to dark.\n- Row 3: all filled, dark.\n\nThe only shapes in the answer set that are filled and dark (matching tone) are choices 1 (black hexagon), 2 (large black hexagon), 5 (black filled circle), 6 (black filled square), 8 (black filled pentagon).\n\nBut row 2 ends with a filled circle. Maybe row 3 should too?\n\nRow pattern possibilities:\n- First row: n, n+1, n+2 sides, all outline shapes.\n- Second row: n, n+1, n+2 sides, all filled, increasingly dark.\n- Third row: n, n+2, n+X sides, all filled.\n\nSince row 3 jumps from square (4 sides) to hexagon (6 sides), perhaps we continue the increase to a shape with 8 sides (octagon). But no octagon is present in the answer set.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the pattern in columns helps.\nColumn 3: pentagon-outline, circle-filled, ?. In row 1 to row 2, the number of sides increases by one: pentagon (5 sides) → circle (infinite).\n\nMaybe row 3 should mirror row 2's progression, so after hexagon (6), comes a circle (infinite sides).\n\nRow 2, third position is a filled circle; so row 3, third position should also be a filled circle.\n\nThe only filled black circle in the answer set is option 5.\n</step_3>\n\n<correct_answer>\n5 (the black filled circle)\n</correct_answer>\n",

In Row 1, the number of sides increases from 3 (triangle), to 4 (square), to 5 (pentagon).\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nIn Row 2, the shapes are (from left) pentagon (outline), triangle (gray fill), diamond/square (gray fill). The pattern seems to be that the shape style rotates by row (outline, shaded, solid), and perhaps the sequence of shapes is shifting right each row.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nIn Row 3, left: diamond/square (solid fill), pentagon (solid fill), missing. The row appears to repeat the order of Row 2 but with each shape moving right. In Row 2: pentagon, triangle, diamond. In Row 3: diamond, pentagon, (should be triangle), all in solid fill.\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nLooking at the columns: \n- Column 1: triangle (outline), pentagon (outline), diamond (solid).\n- Column 2: square (outline), triangle (gray), pentagon (solid).\n- Column 3: pentagon (outline), diamond (gray), missing.\n\nLet's focus on the columns. In Column 2: square (outline), triangle (gray), pentagon (solid). 3 sides increase to 4 (square), then to 5 (pentagon) if you follow triangle to pentagon (skipping square for the fill pattern). Actually, the shapes progress in each column but the style is being filled from outline to semi-filled to full filled.\n</step_5>\n<step_5>\nAlternatively, if we follow the sequence of Row 2: pentagon (outline; left), triangle (gray; middle), diamond (gray; right)\nRow 3: diamond (solid; left), pentagon(solid; middle), missing (right).

Darkly shaded small triangle.\n</step_4>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\nIdentify the rule in the columns: Each column contains three versions of the same shape, progressing from unfilled to lightly filled to darkly filled.\n- Column 1: Triangle (unfilled), Pentagon (unfilled), Diamond (darkly filled).\n- Column 2: Square (unfilled), Triangle (shade), Pentagon (dark fill).\n- Column 3: Pentagon (unfilled), Diamond (light), (missing shape).\nHowever, key is that shapes shift between the rows with their fill intensity increasing from unfilled, to light, to dark.\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\nLook for progression in the rows: Each row has the same type of shapes, but different fills and possibly rearranged.\n- Row 1: Outlines.\n- Row 2: Lightly shaded.\n- Row 3: Darkly shaded.\nBut the actual positions vary: The shape in position (i, j) in one row moves to another position in the next row.\n</step_2>\n<step_3>\nFocus on columns:\n- Column 1: Triangle (outline), Pentagon (outline), Diamond (dark fill).\n- Column 2: Square (outline), Triangle (light fill), Pentagon (dark fill).\n- Column 3: Pentagon (outline), Diamond (light fill), (missing).\nCompare the progression for each shape:\n- Triangle: Outline (1,1), Light fill (2,2), ??? (must be dark fill in (3,3)!)\n- Square/Diamond: Outline (1,2), Light fill (2,3), Dark fill (3,1)\n- Pentagon: Outline (1,3), Light fill (2,1), Dark fill (3,2)\n</step_3>\n<step_4>\nTherefore:\n- The missing (3,3) slot should complete the pattern for the triangle: a darkly filled triangle.\nCheck the answer set for a darkly shaded triangle.\n</step_4>\n<step_5>\nAmong options 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are triangles, but only options 2, 3, and 4 are larger and darkly shaded; 6 and 8 are smaller.\nThe most similar in size and appearance to the triangles used in the matrix is option 2: large, equilateral, darkly shaded, and orientation (point up) matches the pattern best.\n</step_5>\n\n<correct_answer>\n2\n</correct_answer>\n",
