But none of the options offers a single hexagon, except for option 4 (which has a triangle). So cross-check if perhaps we take the cross-row mapping instead: columns go square, pentagon, hexagon; rows repeat this rotation.\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing tile in row 3 should have hexagons, matching the column 3 trend.\nHowever, none of the answer options have only hexagons.\n</step_6>\n\n<step_6>\nYet another approach: Look for the closest visual match for configuration.\n- Since the previous tile in row 3 has three pentagons, does any answer tile have three pentagons?\n- Option 6: Has a pentagon and square (3 shapes total), but not only pentagons.\n- None stand out.\nInstead, perhaps option 7, with small shapes, or option 8, with multiple pentagons, is closest. But option 3, although it also contains triangles, contains pentagons in sizes similar to the 3rd row, 2nd column.\nBut the row 3, third column has a progression 7 → 3 → likely 1 shape, matching previous rows (row 2 third cell is only 1 shape). Answer 4 has only one shape, though it’s a triangle. But perhaps shapes rotate according to the column: column 1—square/diamond/pentagon; column 2—pentagon; column 3—hexagon/hexagon/X.

Middle (gray) has diamond, triangle, hexagon. Bottom (black) has two diamonds, two circles.

Top row third cell: outlined circle, outlined hexagon, outlined triangle, outlined square. Middle row third cell: two filled diamonds, filled hexagon, filled triangle. So, down the column, hexagons and triangles persist, and the diamond appears twice.

Tile 3 has two filled black triangles, one up and one down.", "score": 1.0, "num_mc_correct": 16, "num_mc_total": 16}], "question": "You are an abstract reasoning puzzle expert. The puzzle you will receive is presented in a standard Raven's Progressive Matrices format: a 3×3 matrix of related images, with the bottom-right cell (the ninth tile) missing. There are eight possible answer choices provided separately, and your task is to decide which of those eight images correctly completes the 3×3 matrix pattern.\n\nI will provide you with an image containing:\n- Problem Matrix: An accompanying image that shows the eight tiles and highlights where the ninth is missing.\n- Answer Set: The eight candidate images from which you must choose the best fit for the missing tile.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Review the problem matrix and the accompanying image in sequence, describing step-by-step what you see in the image in <perception> tags.\n- Reason step-by-step about the logical pattern or rule connecting the tiles in <reasoning> tags.\n- Deduce the correct tile from the eight provided options in <correct_answer> tags.\n\nIt is crucial that your solution contains these sections in the exact format described below:\n\n```\n[Perception]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_n>\n...(Step n of step-by-step perception)...\n</step_n>\n\n[Reasoning]\n<step_1>\n...(Step 1 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_1>\n<step_2>\n...(Step 2 of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_2>\n...\n<step_m>\n...(Step m of step-by-step reasoning)...\n</step_m>\n\n<correct_answer>\n...(Clearly state which of the 8 candidate images is the best candidate image as the missing tile to complete the matrix. If the candidates are numbered, lettered, or can be uniquely described, use that identifier.)...\n</correct_answer>\n```\n"}
